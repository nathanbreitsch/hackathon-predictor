A huge time waster for both students and faculty .\\nWhat it does\\nFaculty just needs to take a snap of students sitting in classroom and it will automatically mark and save attendance of students in cloud .  \\nHow I built it\\nApp uses MS Project Oxford Face API for identifying students in group image taken by faculty/professor of all students and saves attendance record in cloud .\\nChallenges I ran into\\nFeeling cold in night ,rest all was manageable .\\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\\nPhottendance as an attendance solution has a definitive edge over other attendance trackers . For e.g. , most of hardware attendance trackers either based on RFID cards , Biometric (thumb impression) etc require a hardware purchase , installation and maintenance charges , on the other Phottendance just needs to be downloaded and is ready to use with zero investment or maintenance .\\nWhat I learned\\nConstraints enforce creativity . I wanted to make a hardware solution for the same but since I'm not that strong with hardware , I focused how the same thing can be achieved by code and cloud . As a result , I developed a totally cloud based solution . I'm sure there are many areas where virtualization can reduce our dependency on hardware.\\nWhat's next for Phottendance\\nCurrently , it's just a Proof Of Concept app . I plan to expand it to more general use cases including but not limited to classroom attendance .\\n\",\n",

As we  don\\'t always check our pet if he is fine or not so, we have added an alert feature also. Like if pet\\'s body temperature is high, you will instantly receive a message stating that : \\n\"Hi! ___(your name), \\nThis is to inform you that your pet is suffering from fever (when temperature is above 104 degree celsius) / serious fever (when temperature is above 106 degree celsius) and it can be fatal if do not take your pet to a veterinary doctor immediately!\\nRegards \\n\"Your ____(your pet\\'s name) Fitbelt\"\\nHow we built it?\\nWe have two main components in this project:\\n1) Our data analysing website which is connected to a web server .\\n2) Our IOT enabled device(which is our fitbelt) which contains of various sensors.its main job is to send data ( body temperature, pulse reading and sleeping pattern) reading  to our website.\\nChallenges we ran into :\\n1) Creating a connection between our device and the dashboard provider\\'s web server!\\n2) Creating an suitable algorithms to detect the health of the pet.\\nAccomplishments that we are proud of:\\nSuccessfully overcoming our challenges .\\nWhat we have learned?\\n=>Learned to create complex algorithms , and how to overcome our challenges and most important TRY..

       " {'description': \"\\nInspiration\\nSeveral insurance firms have tried to break into the activity-specific insurance plan market with limited success. Here, by the term activity-specific insurance market, we are specifically referring to those short tailed insurance plans that target potentially risky short term activities. Since these plans are short term, the insurance company doesn't have to wait for a long time to know whether or not they have made money or not. Since the entire market seemed like a large beast to tackle head-on, we thought of specifically targeting those travellers who have a higher likelihood of indulging in high risk activities such as adventure sports and high altitude mountaineering.\\nNext, we had to make the user realize his/her need for such an insurance. Every time a long weekend is around the corner, several people, especially college going students like ourselves, begin looking for places for a potential outing. Since there are a huge number of websites offering everything from recommendations to reviews to bookings, it becomes a cumbersome (and often tiresome) process to sift through potential locations, trying to see which place fits our expectations of what is ideal. \\nTravel Jarvis is a single platform where you can learn more about holiday activities and destinations that are tailor-made for you, and also optionally buy a reasonably priced, customized insurance plan. \\nWhat it does\\nIn a nutshell, Travel Jarvis is a personality based travel risk assessment and short tailed insurance recommendation system.\\nAt a high level, it infers the user’s personality from their Twitter profile and provides a custom list of attractions. Next, the user can view the risk associated with each of these attractions and decide which ones that he would potentially visit. (Some risks that are shown are criminal risk, safety risks and precipitation risks. These risks are calculated from data that is obtained from APIs.) We also use Bluemix's Trade-off Analytics API to maximize the reward to risk ratio. Then, based on the selections, a collection of insurance plans (from the database of the insurance policy aggregator) are suggested to the user. If the user chooses an insurance plan that isn't being offered yet, the insurance aggregator is notified, so that they may take a decision on whether or not to offer that policy in the future or not.  \\nHow we built it\\nWe started by using the twitter handle of the person to get insights about his personality and then giving a list of a attractions suitable for the person in the desired place. Then we use several API’s for getting data related to precipitation, crime, safety etc in that location. This data was used to create the risk profile of a tourist attraction/ adventure activity for the days he wishes to visit. Then we use IBM Watson’s Trade-Off Analytics API to help the user choose between the various attractions based on the risk and his interest. Then the user can choose several places that he wishes to visit and then he can get recommendations for insurance that he or she can buy or wish to buy. \\nChallenges we ran into\\nUsing the trade-off analytics API because the sample app uses a static json file from the file system but using a  custom JSON fetched from the back-end took us a lot of time. Apart from this, trying to come up with a user interface that matches the high expectation of the users these days.\\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\\nWe are proud of the fact that we got a application up and running by the end of the hackathon. \\nWe jumped into untested waters and continuously ran into bottlenecks  one after the other. But with a strongly willed team and many experts to guide us, we were eventually able to put our thoughts into a working application.\\nWhat we learned\\nWe worked on the IBM’s Bluemix Platform and used some very powerful API’s that it provided . We learned that design thinking is really important and makes a huge difference, even for a one day long project. By thinking of the user from the beginning, our entire development perspective took a different turn. \\nWe also learned tremendously from both the domain experts from Swiss Re and the technology experts from IBM. Overall, the hackathon was a rewarding experience for all of us.\\nWhat's next for Travel Jarvis\\nIn future Travel Jarvis would act as a platform where the Insurance Companies come and realize the demand for short tailed insurances as posted by the users. They get an opportunity to get introduced to new products based on demand. It can create  a whole new market of  personalised, activity specific insurances, a market that insurance companies have tried for a long time to break into.\\n\",\n",

It analyses all the data and factors for individual crops and suggests the crop that would most likely yield maximum returns on investment to the farmer.\\nIn effect, the accuracy of the decision involved in processing the various factors is enhanced significantly. This would lead to better returns on investment to the farmer. Ensuring the growth of the farmer, the economy & the nation at large.\\nHow we built it\\nIn a nut shell, I would put it as “Suggesting which crop to harvest considering all the factors that might be affecting the growth”. It sounds very simple, but in reality it is a quite a task. Hence, we decided to create an Application that would do just that. Based on all the analytics & data processing technologies available.\\nWhat we learned\\nWhen we started to look closely into the situation, we realized that the farmer was just like a typical entrepreneur. Except his new venture would begin every 3 or 6 months. Now we’re all aware of the Startup success rate (Mostly 10%); but then, how is the farmer supposed to make a living when his crops fail? Without any other means for livelihood he’d have no other choice but suicide. \\nThis led us to start understanding the dynamics of farming and the reasons it would fail. When started looking at all the variables such as Growth period, Soil type, Water requirement, Ideal temperature, Relative humidity, Rainfall behavior, Incidence of light, Rate of degradation, Resistance to pest & diseases; we could start to understand the difficulty in farming. \\nNow, just like most of the population, who blame the farming for his un-wise decision of choosing a crop that would fail; we would respectfully disagree. Making the choice of the Crop to start with is a lot more complicated than what we would perceive it to be. In fact, we couldn’t crack it with our University graduations; expecting a farmer who is most probably illiterate to pick the right crop would most likely be impossible.\\nWhat's next for Krishi\\nBuilding a Hardware to Monitor the Farm Continuously & consistently to help ensure better safety & security for Insurance Companies.\\n\",\n",

In our personal experiences with time management and the chaos of our daily lives, sometimes fitness comes secondary to everything else that is going on. Fitness is evidently a major global issue indicating by the astonishing obesity rates in the country. Incentivising fitness and providing penalties for forgetting daily exercise is a perfect solution for those who are interested in sticking to their goals. \\nWhat it does\\nWhen a customer signs up for our services, we require that It utilizes Android’s built in GPS services to calculate the distance that you travel. Using Java (Android Studio),  as well as Google play services it charges the user weekly if they didn't run the specified amount. We also used different activities that go on different pages to have the code run easily and be easily navigable.\\nHow we built it\\nWe programmed an Android application which uses Android Location services to track the distance (in meters) which we then converted to miles. Each page of the application is an activity in android studio. We have activities that record distance, demonstrate the distance traveled out of whole distance goal per week and daily and we have a page for the settings of the app. We also have a payment information page which the user inputs their data for the payment when they are unable to run the distance per week or per day. \\nChallenges we ran into\\nSome of the challenges we ran into were that the distance wasn't correctly calculating, and because it was a long it would export out values up to ten decimals. Other times, we forgot to include the line which actually receives the location of the user (we sent out a team member to run a mile twice and they had returned without any information actually uploaded). Furthermore, some issues included not importing libraries and having activites run on the same page which would cause things to overlap each other.\\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\\nOur sleek, user friendly platform and the applicability of this app\\nWhat we learned\\nWhen we first looked into how we were going to store the data we learned that Parse was shutting down its services [ :( ] so we had to look for other ways to store data and settled on using Android’s built in shared preferences. We also learned how to integrate external APIs like google play and paypal (although we didn’t end up using this).     \\nWhat's next for 1HUNDRED%\\nMonetary penalties is just one form of incentives we would like to offer our customers in the future. In having daily and weekly penalties, we have attempted to create a system that develops the habit of daily exercise. To further instill this principle, we plan to give our customers the option of locking their phones and other electronic devices (hooked up to a Google Service system) during a particular time in a day (which is decided that the beginning of the week). \\nWe plan to offer integration features for customers with Fitbits and other Wearable technology that will allow them to track their heart rate, pulse and speed. We would offer to incentivise these other measurements to our competitive trainees to improve or maintain their game daily. \\n\",\n",

So our team came up with an idea that would streamline the process of getting emergency services in the case of an urgent situation.  \\nWhat it does\\nEncased in a beautifully crafted thermal pullover, SNO uses an accelerometer to track the force of the snowboarder or skier to report and call for help if a crash occurs. A bluetooth sensor will relay to an app on your phone that will send information about your location and current situation to emergency services and the owner of the slope to ensure speedy help in the event of a crisis. SNO will also relay information about weather alerts like upcoming blizzards and avalanches to the user.\\nHow we built it\\nOne of the first steps was to craft the thermal jacket, which will provide the user with both warmth without weight and the services of SNO. An arduino fitted with an accelerometer was encased in the hooded portion of the pullover.\\nChallenges we ran into\\nOur team was encompassed of entirely first time hackers, so there was a learning curve in terms of both hardware and software. One team member even spent the first few hours learning Python from square one.\\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\\nOur team did a really great job of learning from each other and using quick research skills to figure out all of the missing pieces. We also are incredibly happy to present a functional and stylish garment.\\nWhat we learned\\nAni learned Python in one night! We also learned a bit about arduino, increased our knowledge of html, swift, javascript, the Google Maps API, and Amazon Web Hosting.\\nWhat's next for SNO\\nWe hope to make an even better user interface to help ski slope operators to make a more enjoyable and safer experience for their customers. We also hope to downsize our accelerometer and arduino into a more wearable micro controller that will fit more ergonomically with the thermal pullover jacket.\\n\",\n",

       " {'description': '\\nInspiration\\nI recently purchased the Bellabeat Leaf wearable, which tracks activity, breathing and steps, but is unable to track heart rate. After using the Leaf for a month, I\\'ve found that the deep breathing exercises are often the most relaxing part of my day. I\\'ve even begun the habit of deep breathing whenever I feel anxious, which often mutes any stirring anxiety. \\nHowever, sometimes I don\\'t notice I\\'m beginning a stress episode until it\\'s too late.  Speaking to another KFTH attendee today, I realized that I\\'m not the only one who this happens to. In this day and age, we\\'re all frequently overwhelmed by the kind of stress that scatters your thoughts, glitches your words and turns simple tasks into complex challenges.\\nWhat\\'s bothering anyone at the time of a stressful episode may be readily apparent emotionally, but it can be hard to pinpoint exactly at what point in the day you began going downhill, and what caused it. In addition, we often have biased perspectives of both our own actions and the actions of those around us that prevent us from seeing causation subjectively.\\nChopin is smart, subjective solution to living a calmer, slower life. Chopin will be able to track your stress levels and analyze what exactly is bothering you. Chopin will sense when you\\'re beginning to get anxious, and gently remind you to slow down and take a breath. \\nYou\\'ll be able to make more informed decisions, and finally be able to breathe again. \\nWhat it does\\nChopin\\'s \"pin\" is bandaged to the wrist by a strip of chiffon. Alternatively, the pin can be strapped to the Bellabeat Leaf so that the sensor rests against the skin, augmenting the wearable\\'s functionality.\\nThe pin tracks your heartbeat, taking note of irregularities (speedups, slowdowns) and sending the data to the cloud to be analyzed. When your pulse quickens, Chopin will gently blink to indicate that you should slow down and do some deep breathing exercises.\\nChopin will provide reports on your most relaxed and most stressful moments. You\\'ll be able to notice weekly, monthly and even seasonal patterns.  Integrating with google calendars, Chopin can even figure out what you were doing at the time. \\nHow I built it\\nChopin\\'s hardware consists of a heartrate moniter and LED attatched to a raspberry pi running Python.\\nThe script then regularly transmits data to the AWS cloud via MQTT messaging to be analyzed, and the user can use a web interface to review data.\\nChallenges I ran into\\nConfiguring Chopin to communicate with my Amazon AWS instance was problematic and I was unable to finish it before the deadline.  In addition, the heartbeat moniter is sometimes overly sensitive and records movements as heartbeats.\\nAccomplishments that I\\'m proud of\\nI learned how to use the GPIO components of the Raspberry Pi and also taught myself how to put together basic circuits. Since there was no documentation, I reverse-engineered the pulse sensor (which was made for arduino) and was able to use it on the Pi. I learned how to provision an EC2 instance on Amazon and even began tackling the IoT framework.\\nWhat I learned\\nI became intimately familiar with the raspberry pi, as well as it\\'s GPIO.\\nWhat\\'s next for Chopin\\nOnce debugging post-hackathon, I would like to continue prototyping both the wearable and the app.\\nFor the wearable, I would like to keep it in a small encasing that easily attatches to fabrics and jewelry. It will use Bluetooth Low Energy to eventually communicate with a phone app to cut out the bulk of the pi. I would also prefer to replace the glowing light stress alarm with a soft vibration.\\nIn addition, Chopin\\'s reporting capabilities willl expand beyond google maps. Chopin will one day look at social media posts, pictures, the news, and weather to suggest what may be bothering you and how to solve it. Chopin will also offer meditation and breathing exercises, during which your hearbeat and breathing will be tracked by the wearable to help establish progress and improvement.\\nI hope to see Chopin become a commercial product in the near future, so people like me and Dina can have help navigating the chaos of modern day life.\\n',\n",

While attempting to find an idea for a security-related hack, we realized that already existing RFID tags in retail stores could both send and receive information. This gave us the idea to allow people to interact with them.\\nWhat it does\\nThis is a mobile application that would allow customers to purchase retail items by scanning an RFID chip with their mobile device. By scanning the chip, they receive information about the item including price, an image, and a product description. Once payment has been confirmed, the RFID\\'s security feature can be disabled by our application so that the user may take the item from the store.\\nHow we built it\\nBecause we did not have access to RFID tags, we substituted in an electric-imp to simulate a tag. The electric-imp is linked to a URL, which upon visiting turns off the connected LED that symbolizes the activation of an RFID tag\\'s security feature. We integrated this functionality within our app, so that we can remotely \"scan\" the item that the tag is associated with, and upon   We used an electric-imp, an Internet of Things platform. to communicate with our mobile device via wifi, Android Studio to build our mobile application, and Twitter Bootstrap to create our website.\\nChallenges we ran into\\nIt was an arduous task to find a hardware solution that modeled an RFID tag compatible with our software. The hardware lab ran out of Arduino microcontrollers and bluetooth shields, so we experimented with a tiny-duino, several Intel Edison boards, which all for some reason refused to work with our computers. So after trying out seven different boards, we finally arrived at our savior: the electric-imp. \\nWhat we learned\\nAll of us came in either rusty or inexperienced with Android. All of our UI skills received tons of practice, so much so that one of our team members initially with zero experience with Android Studio, was successfully helping build non-trivial parts of the application by the end of the project. We also all got some experience using the electric-imp!\\n',\n",

       " {'description': \"\\nInspiration\\nSimply adding technology to a wearable item does not make it more impactful and improve on the lives of the users. We feel that it is important to design products that solve problems, utilizing technology in order to assist in this process. By focusing on alleviating the pain and discomfort caused by menstruation, we seek to underscore the hidden challenges of womanhood. Ideally, through clever design, we hope to accomplish this goal without making those challenges any more visible to an outside observer.\\nWhat it does\\nOur underwear functions as a covert, convenient, and drug-free way to seek relief from menstrual cramps and/or lower back pain. This undergarment can soothe the discomfort of the wearer though its self-contained heating pad from within a removable compression panel. This will ideally allow the wearer to continue with their daily activities that would have previously been disrupted. The heating element is accessible and adjustable through a free, downloadable mobile phone app. This app can also help track the menstrual cycle, giving the user a notification reminder a few days before their cycle is expected to begin.\\nHow we built it\\nThis project came together in three parts: the garment, the hardware, and the software. Using an existing pair of underwear, we created and customized a pattern to better suit the needs of our product. Fabrics were carefully selected in order to make a comfortable and fashionable pair of underwear, utilizing innovative solutions to add in a smartphone-controlled compression and heating panel. The heating element for this piece came from Prometheus Technologies, who designed the 2Degree Jacket, which “incorporates ultra-thin heating and power technology to allow the wearers to customize the jacket’s temperature using an app installed on their smartphones or smart watch.” Using technology from the hack rack in the fashion lab, we created a sleek device controller by connecting an Arduino Uno to a Low Energy Shield Bluetooth. The Bluetooth connects to a smartphone via an app. This app has a temperature on/off and control switch, sending data to the controller, which acts accordingly.\\nChallenges we ran into\\nDespite our vision to create a product that would exist inside a pair underwear, no one on our team is fully competent with a sewing machine. This lack of expertise made the task of garment making quite daunting. We wanted to make a functional-yet-fashionable product as well, which involved the use of knit fabrics and lace, adding to the difficulty of our project. Collectively, our team also had no pattern making experience We relied on innovation and some helpful tips from mentors and fashion students to assist us through the pattern-making process. We were further challenged by the limitations of the supplies and tools we brought with us, in addition to the limited technical hardware that was provided by the Hackathon. There were a plethora of issues that came up during the software and hardware programming stages, too as we were working with a generally unfamiliar chip. Lastly, as a small group of diverse individuals, we encountered difficulties with our different styles of communication, working habits, and skill sets. There were more than a few instances where we were not on the same page as a group, and had to stop and catch up.\\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\\nBefore we started this project, we were all strangers to each other. Our group organically formed, by happenstance, with each of us having a different area of expertise. While the responsibilities for our collaboration were divided according to our individual skill-sets, we all came away from this project with new knowledge. Rachel now almost knows how the technology in our project works. Azim learned how to use the Serger machine and by the end of the project, and easily could have sewed almost the entire project because he’s awesome. \\nRachel is especially proud of Azim and Charlie for being open to working on a project that aims to ease the experience of menstruation\\nWhat we learned\\nAll of us learned how to collaborate and trust the skills of each other, despite being strangers as of Friday. We overcame working outside of our comfort zones.\\nAzim learned how to bridge between Objective-C and Swift, connecting Arduino Uno with Bluetooth shield to an iPhone, and how to use Serger machine.\\nCharlie learned that there’s almost always an easier solution to the problem at hand and  about how Bluetooth Low Energy works at a lower level.\\nRachel learned that incorporating technology into wearable objects is not unattainable, as long as you are able to work with people who know how to do it. (She still barely know how the tech aspects of this project work.) Serger machines are not nearly as terrifying as they used to be, and she understands the basics of working with knit fabrics and creating patterns.\\nWhat's next for SmarterWear\\nWe would like to continue to develop the app database, allowing for tracking of cycle variations, which can assist healthcare providers in analysis. This current design of undergarments is targeted towards females, but there are many other people who can benefit from this device, such as transgender men and people who have kidney stones or other health issues.\\nBuilt With\\nCare, Compassion, Patience, Lack of Sleep, Caffeine, and Collaboration\\nNon-Computer Tech Skills: pattern-making, Serger and standard sewing machines\\n\",\n",

Parse provides easy deployment of mobile and web apps using their Javascript and mobile SDKs which simplify database interactions and utilization of services such as location and login security.\\nThe actual app was build by Daniel using apache cordova and Ionic. Cordova is a technology that allows you to build mobile apps using HTML/Javascript. Ionic builds upon cordova by adding in angular.js, a popular web framework that makes organizing large applications much more manageable. These technologies enabled us to build a polished, aesthetically pleasing app in the time allotted by a hackathon.\\nWe also took advantage of the google maps API for finding locations, and visualizing the data.\\nChallenges we ran into\\nIntegrating the backend framework with the front end. \\nGetting google maps to work with angular properly took a bit of time.\\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\\nProviding cool looking data visualization, because it allows people to see the volume and possible impact of conflicts around their communities and beyond.\\nWhat we learned\\nHow to integrate a cordova app with Parse (which neither of us knew how to do).\\nHow to use the advanced features of the google maps API to better visualize data in an awesome way.\\nWhat's next for CoPower\\nFuture integration of skilled representatives that may be able to provide legal advice to people with conflicts. This would be a possible monetization route, and we could use the money gained to hire specialized staff to assist with conflicts.\\nCould potentially provide unions access to the workers who have all these conflicts to gather data about said conflicts or to assist these workers as best they can.\\n\",\n",

       " {'description': '\\nInspiration\\n  The world is a dangerous place, and you don\\'t always have a way to go about your day safely without worry. With OnWatch, we help you do things alone confidently by resting assured that your emergency contacts are just a click away. Pebble\\'s innovative technology allows us to facilitate securely, discreetly, and efficiently.\\n\\nWhat it does\\n  Our application benefits those who find themselves in a dangerous or uncomfortable situation and need a quick discreet way to ask for help.. With this new application, which is free via download and easily accessible, it will give notice to the user\\'s preset emergency contacts informing them of the user\\'s current situation along with his/her location via google maps.  Then, the person has the option to choose four settings: safe, alert, threat, and \"911.\" Safe means that the person is in no danger, and that no one should be worried or alerted. Alert means a possibility that something might go wrong, and two text messages are sent to two different contacts in the user\\'s phone, telling them that they\\'re uncomfortable. Threaten means something bad is happening to the person, and the application sends text messages stating the condition of the person (i.e. threaten) to all of the person\\'s contacts. Last but not least, emergency means dire situation, and a text to 911 will be sent immediately. The first three settings can be accessed by clicking the up or down button. which changes the degree of severity for the person\\'s current state, and then the android app can select yes to send the respective texts. The last setting, on the other hand, can only be accessed by holding down the select button for more than two seconds to avoid any accidental \"butt-dials\". \\n\\nHow we built it\\n  We built our application by using both Android Studios and PebbleCloud. We started with the Android Studios because we wanted to make our project usable on mobile phones. Furthermore, we wanted to transfer the text messages to the specific contacts via phone, and the only way it was possible for us at the time was to have a mobile app that would do this. As an added bonus, the text messages also sent the user\\'s location so that the user can be found if trouble occurs. We then moved on to PebbleCloud, where we used C to code the last bits of the app. At first, we were going to solely use Android Studios to complete the application. However, we figured that pulling out our phones out and then selecting our contacts would be too slow, when we could do the same thing on a watch and just press a few buttons. This efficiency in time could mean the difference between life and death, which would make the application that much more meaningful.\\n\\nChallenges we ran into\\n  There were three challenges that really stumped us, which almost made it not possible for us to finish our mobile application. The first challenge was getting the location of the user. This turned out to be a daunting task because the easiest way was to access one of Google\\'s APIs, but we didn\\'t have access to the required key. We were forced to google other ways to determine how to track a user\\'s location, and a lot of the sites were uninformative and unhelpful. We eventually solved this challenge when we thought of google maps, where we replicated its location functionality search via GPS. The second challenge was syncing PebbleCloud and the Android Studios. Using google, there were no clear instructions on how to make the android app \"talk\" with Pebble and to access its functionalities that we wrote in PebbleCloud. We eventually solved this by combining chunks of multiple tutorials that we deemed helpful and doing anything possible to make it work. A huge factor that we did for example, was making sure that the UUID matched so they could remotely be connected. The last challenge was storing the contacts, which wasn\\'t too challenging, except for the fact that we didn\\'t want any databases to store the contacts and profiles. It was slightly daunting by just remembering the login info when the user first logged onto his/her account, and then immediately pulling up the contacts from the phone list itself. We fixed this by having the user to enter the desired contacts that the user wants to message and save on the phone list, kind of like speed dialing but not limited to only nine dials.   \\n\\nAccomplishments that we\\'re proud of\\n  The first accomplishment that we are proud of is solving the three biggest challenges within the allotted time. This required an incredible amount of brainstorming ideas and implementations so that we can make our ideas come to life. Another accomplishment that we are proud of is working together as a team. Each individual is assigned with a different task, and without the contributions of all the individuals, this project wouldn\\'t have been completed on time. Last but not least, the other accomplishment that we are proud of is learning new things. At a hackathon, we are given a set of strict and obscure challenges that we need to satisfy. For the majority of the time, we have to adapt and try out new things. For example, we had to learn how to use PebbleCloud, which was extremely frustrating because learning a new language itself is always a challenge. But what makes this by far the proudest accomplishment is that we learned it together. If someone doesn\\'t understand a certain functionality or some other aspect of the new language, we would all work together to make sure that everyone was up to pace. This made sure that everyone knew what he/she was doing, making it a lot more efficient in completing the mobile application. \\n\\nWhat we learned\\n  There were many things that we learned during our creation of the mobile application. For starters, some of us were new to gitHub and its repositories/commit functions, and this was an important knowledge that everyone needed to know for their future work and tasks. Next, we learned how to use Android Studios a lot better. Many of us were novices at Android Studio, only knowing the mere basics of how to make a button for an example. After doing this project, we are way more comfortable using Android Studios and more importantly confident in our own abilities.\\n\\nWhat\\'s next for OnWatch\\n  For our next update on the application OnWatch, we will have a special way to access the emergency setting in case there\\'s absolutely no time to hold the button down or someone is physically unable to use the emergency setting the regular way. An idea that is possible to make this happen is to have technology that can scan your unique fingerprint that will automatically reach 911, like a panic button of some sort. Furthermore, better layouts will be implemented, including cool and exciting new features that will make it much more convenient on the user\\'s life, such as the Pebble becoming a strong flashlight. \\n\\nSponsor Prize/Prizes\\n  We are entering the Tech Cares category as well as the pebble development subcategory.\\n\\n',\n",

This allows for managers to keep track of the satisfaction of many employees with ease.

It requires Pebble SDK 3.9-beta7. Once the Pebble Health API is out of beta, we plan to publish HealthNet.\\nInspiration\\nThe Pebble Health app was released at the end of last year but the API is still in beta. So we decided to get in the hackathon spirit and do some real hacking.\\nThe Pebble Health application is great at tracking your steps and sleep, but that’s about all it does at this point. We set out to make a health analytics application that gives users insights on the data Pebble has been gathering for them.\\nPlanned Improvements\\n1) We plan on adding timeline support. Our eventual goal for HealthNet is for it to offer insights throughout the day. For example, we’d love to correlate activity (step count) and sleep and send timeline notifications to the user when there are relevant insights. We\\'ll develop an algorithm that relates a user\\'s mood to their activity and sleep level, and we\\'ll let the user know what conditions have them feeling best. We\\'ll also recommend getting more sleep and being more active when our algorithm detects that a lack of one might cause them to have a worse mood. \\nExamples of timeline notifications:\\n\"You sleep 17% better on days when you\\'ve been more active than average.\"\\n\"You sleep best when you to go to bed before 12am. Why not try it out tonight and see how you feel tomorrow?\"\\n2) Expanding the graph and statistics page to display more data. We\\'ll change the statistics page to a menu that a user can scroll through to see additional days as well as 7-, 14-, and 30-day averages with the activity, amount of sleep, and mood of the user. We\\'ll change the graph page so that the user can also load different days and composites of time periods, rather than just the last four days.\\nHow we built it\\nCurrently, you can only use the Pebble Health API with the beta Pebble SDK. HealthNet is written in C and uses only the Pebble SDK.\\nChallenges We ran into\\nFor three out of the four on our team, this was our first time using C, so there was that. Two on our team had experience using PebbleJS but PebbleC was a whole new beast before the begining of this 36 hour code binge. Sean and I recieved runner up for best Pebble Hack at HackingEDU 2015. We wrote an arithmetic game called DailEQs with PebbleJS and CloudPebble.\\nWe ran into some challenges because we weren’t able to use the beta Pebble SDK with CloudPebble. This meant all of our testing had to be done on an offline emulator that was quite buggy.\\nTesting our application on an actual Pebble Smartwatch was another challenge. Pebble releases the beta SDK publicly but does not release the beta firmware. We had to contact Katherine Berry at Pebble in order to get an unsigned firmware update.\\nAbout Us\\nWe’re three third year transfer students at UCSC and one freshmen at UCSB.\\nSean Dougher gets into Dougher mode, where he stays up all night programming; we wouldn’t have an application without him. Brian put the team on his back with his expertise in C and debugging skills. Peter took charge of the tedious task of hacking the UI with Sean and writing the code that generates graphs. Michael brought the Linux so we could use the beta Pebble SDK (he also risked blowing up his Pebble Time by installing a sketchy unsigned firmware update sent via Slack). \\n',\n",

With the advent of telecommunications, a multitude of tools have become available for people to communicate to each other and organize, but these tools have failed in some regards. \\n-Some of the social networks that people use have become more of a distraction than an actual place of connection or active participation. They have contributed greatly to generating a feeling of conformity and passive activism. \\n-They have failed to become relevant in those moments and places where they could be very useful for activists, such as marches, protests, rallies, general assemblies, decision making processes, committees, to mention a few. \\n-Propelled by an ever-growing profit-driven industry, these tools are becoming increasingly unsafe, infringing upon the user’s privacy rights and making their information available to questionable entities. Privacy and freedom of information are becoming less of a right, and more of a privilege. \\nPeople in the technology world have seen these issues and built a plethora of alternatives, ranging from social networks that protect your data from third party providers, private and anonymous email, chat rooms and forums. However, these tools have yet to be properly designed and launched for the end user. Usually individuals will require a great amount of technical knowledge to use them and/or feel intimidated by the poor user interfaces and technical jargon that these tools feature. \\nWe would like to bridge these ideas and to create a platform that is built by activists and not corporations, secure, private, and decentralized, while at the same time being accessible and user friendly. \\nWhat it does\\nThe app allows the organizer of an event, such as a protest, a rally or a general assembly to create an event \"feed\" or \"page\". Users can input their zipcode and find a list of events near their area. The event feed includes an update section and a map. \\nThe map has the following features: \\n-Users can drag and drop icons to the map to signal different markers. The markers include shelter, food, water, police presence, assembly, supplies such as gas masks, medical attention and literature. \\n-Each marker dragged becomes an update in the feed. \\nThe feed has the following features:\\n-Users can input any sort of text updates about the event.\\nHow I built it\\nWe built this web application using the meteor development framework, along with bootstrap, javascript, and other web languages.\\nChallenges I ran into\\nWriting and debugging lots of code code, interaction between different modules, exhaustion and back pain. \\nAccomplishments that I\\'m proud of\\nWe started from scratch, with very little experience, and built something that is slowly getting closer to our vision and our goal of taking the social out of social network and turning it into justice. \\nWhat I learned\\nAn incredible amount of stuff about web application development, languages that we weren\\'t familiar with and most importantly, the intersectionality between social justice and technology\\nWhat\\'s next for RioTor\\nRioTor will continue to be an ongoing project. We are excited to see what this platform could become. These are some of the goals for the future:\\n-RioTor, as its name suggest will be accessed through the Tor hidden network. Potentially, the user will be able to accomplish this easily. Multiple layers of security and encryption will be added so that not only the user\\'s data is kept private and untraceable, but our servers can defend against any type of attacks or attempts to steal information. \\n-More features will be added, such as ways to protect organizers against law enforcement repression, tools for democratic assembly and decision making, ability to receive notifications on your phone,  message other users and invite people in your area to events, among others. \\n-Users can upload photos and videos of the event, essentially turning the feed into a live photo-journalistic recollection of the action from multiple perspectives. These photos and videos can also be used to prevent and fight against police brutality and state repression. \\nWe\\'re standing on the shoulders of giants. Hacktivism has existed for a long time. In addition, others have already shown interest in joining us. Hopefully RioTor will become a growing community of tech people who care and stand up for others. \\n',\n",

This would be a simple monetary incentive for users to step back every time they de-stress, which is beneficial for their insurance providers, whose best interest is in keeping the user alive as long as possible (they would pay out the reward to the user through discounts on premiums for the year or a similar effect).\\nFinally, users can track their progress and see how well and often they respond to these pings, so they can see the long-term benefits of their improvements.\\nHow we built it\\nThis app was built on iOS using core graphics and animations for the game, and other basic frameworks for the rest of the app. It interacts with a server instance on azure which can give it current heart rate information (to spoof a heart rate monitor, which we didn't have access to). \\nChallenges we ran into\\nUnfortunately we realized early that none of the hardware provided would give us the heart rate data we needed, so we decided to build a model which could effectively re-create a heart beat dataset, which could then be used to test the app. \\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\\nWe had an idea that had a lot of real world merit, but didn't fit our circumstances (no heart rate monitor). Instead of abandoning it for a second tier idea, we put even more work than we would have, and created an even more compelling prototype. \\nWhat we learned\\nWe learned about the importance of the visual elements used in an app that helps you de-stress. Colours, sounds, and the overall experience should be finely tuned to match the expected needs of the user, to both encourage repeat usage and maximize results during use.\\nWhat's next for Zenotify\\nWe're hoping to acquire wearables which can sense this heart rate data, so we can build a fully functional version of the app and launch to the app-store.\\n\",\n",

It was fascinating to browse the gallery of all the Haikus that the internet hive-mind had created. Most were nonsensical, some were profane, and some were actually quite beautiful. Lots were funny, sometimes repulsive, and once in a while thought provoking. \\nBrowsing that gallery was a fascinating insight into the cumulative mindset of the internet.\\nBut why limit yourself to the few words of a haiku when a picture is worth a thousand words?\\nWe thought it would be interesting to see what would happen if we asked the internet to contribute to a massive art project, with each user contributing a small fraction to recreate images.\\nWhat it does\\nBy combining the countless small colored chunks submitted by users, BIGpicture can produce uniquely stylized interpretations of images.\\nUpon first logging on, users are presented with a simple task: color in this square.\\nThey see a rough outline of what they have to draw, and try their best to color. They doesn't have to be prefect, as long as they match up the lines, and line up the colors, magic will happen. We make each chunk small enough so that anyone of any artistic level can color it, but large enough so that they have features to outline.\\nOnce they hit submit, they get to a page where they can view all of the art people before them have made, and are also presented with a list of paintings currently being drawn.\\n\\nIf they are up for more, they can contribute another square to any of the collages they want.\\n-If they are done, they can just browse the completed gallery, or even watch collages being filled in real time!\\n\\nRegardless of what they chose,  the user has contributed to this massive art-project, and has helped create a unique reinterpretation of an image, an interpretation only possible when countless people come together to make art.\\nChallenges we ran into\\nGetting the drawing canvases set up and using websockets was relatively painless.\\nUI, UX on the other hand, that was a whole new level of frustrating. We got it to a nice state, but we think this GIF explains UI, UX development perfectly: (http://i.imgur.com/Q3cUg29.gif)\\nRegardless, we managed to implement roughly 90% of the features we set out to include, with those features implemented seeming to be relatively stable.

There's too many to fit in Dropbox, and backing them up online is a slow and tedious thing. To protect them, I have automated backups of my photos and thought that was enough.\\nThen, out of the blue, Lightroom just outright refused to work with one of my photos. As I tried more photos, Lightroom just continued giving me errors. Clearly, my hard drive was dying, but I was fine, I had backups.\\nExcept some of the restored photos still didn't work. Clearly my backup was backing up bad files, and had been for a while. It was only luck that I had a much older backup that still had uncorrupted files.\\nWhat I needed was a tool that would run automatically, and let me know if anything happened to my files before they become irrecoverable.\\nWhat it does\\nMost files don't change all that often. The plugin takes advantage of that by taking an initial hash of the file, and then periodically rehashing the file, and making sure it still matches.\\nHow I built it\\nAs it was going to be part of Lightroom, I had to use the Lightroom API. I started with a general idea of what I wanted the plugin to look like, and iterated on it as I hit certain milestones. \\nIt was a lot of trial and error - for example, I first had to test the hashing function, to make sure the output matched a reference tool. Next was using the API to associate the hash with the file in a permanent manner. Then being able to batch retrieve that value for multiple images. There was always a next step to do, so I never ran out of things to add - only time to do it in.\\nChallenges I ran into\\nThe primary problem was that the tools just aren't present. Lightroom uses a customized version of Lua with fun things like seemingly non-deterministic sorts.\\nAdditionally, some things I wanted to do with Lightroom just weren't documented - like the actual hashing algorithm. I ended up using an API method that had been around for the last 3 versions of Lightroom, but undocumented\\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\\nThis is one of the few plugins that I know about that can run tasks automatically whenever Lightroom starts up. That alone is pretty significant in my book.\\nI also got to learn for more about how to do actions in Lua - things like iterating over lists of files.\\nFinally, I ran the plugin against all my images, and I can now sleep somewhat better knowing I have a way to protect them.\\nWhat I learned\\nA whole bunch about Lua, Lightroom, and the fact that even if the official API doesn't allow you to do certain tasks, chances are you can work around it in a manner that ends up being somewhat more elegant.\\nWhat's next for Lightroom Verifier\\nReleasing it to the world after writing some documentation.\\n\",\n",

We wanted to solve this problem, and StudySqr was born.\\nWhat it does\\nStudySqr is a mobile app that allows you to see what subjects people are studying and where they are studying them, and it allows you to have group study sessions on the fly. Let\\'s say I want to study for a certain course, in this example, MATH239. Using StudySqr, I can search for all study sessions taking place for MATH239, and when I find one I like, I can check-in to it. If I want to create my own study session, I can do so, and people looking to study MATH239 can check-in to my session.\\nHow we built it\\nWe used a variety of technologies. To build the app itself, we created a native Android application using Android Studio. We stored the \"events\" (study sessions) in a Mongo database in the cloud. We created an API using Node.js in order to allow the Android application to access the events and to create new entries in the database. We created a website as well, using HTML and CSS. We used Github for version control.\\nChallenges we ran into\\nA challenge we ran into involved connecting the Android application to the backend. None of us have worked with HTTP requests in Android before, and our lack of knowledge on the topic slowed down our progress. We eventually learned that requests have to be sent in a separate thread than the main application thread, and after this realization, we fixed our code and the requests started to work. We were able to connect the app to the backend :)\\nAccomplishments that we\\'re proud of\\nWe are proud of the fact that we were able to create a full working version of the Android app, a fully implemented backend, and even a website for our application! This was our first time working together, so we are also proud that we were able to get along and perform well in a group. Lastly, though we faced challenges along the way, we didn\\'t back down and we overcame them!\\nWhat we learned\\nThrough the creation of StudySqr, we were all able to learn more about the technologies that we used. We learned what each of our strengths are, and this will be useful when we work together on future projects. We also learned how long each of us could stay awake for :P\\nWhat\\'s next for StudySqr\\nWe want to create an iOS app! Additionally, our application is easily extendable, and we want to immediately extend it to campuses aside from the University of Waterloo.

There are a lack of resources for accurately being able to get a list of possible new homes. Vaughan, being a graduate this upcoming year, and Scott graduating in a years time, this applies to us directly. Furthermore, coming into this hackathon we both had an interest in working with large sets of open data. \\nWhat it does\\nAcre utilizes large sets of open data to provide the user with an idea of where they can start, or continue, their career. Our queries integrate factors such as: job title, job demand, lifestyle choices and the user\\'s native language to generate a list of cities that are actually suited for that person. For example, the \\'Job Title\\' option uses your occupation to check against current salaries in that field to give you an average of what the income will be like in that area. \\nHow I built it\\nWe built it using a classic JavaScript stack: React.js, with material design, on the frontend and MongoDB on the backend. We picked React.js for the ease-of-use in handling JavaScript state mutation. Implementing the flux software architecture, React promotes modularized, unidirectional data flow to more easily manage the state of the application.\\nThe back end is written with MongoDB as discussed before, with a Node.js backend to drive the REST API. There\\'s some significant math going on behind the scenes -- including some multiple criteria decision making which is subjective in nature. We used open data for the criteria -- things ranging from job data, such as salaries and demands, populatioin densities, and all the other factors people might care about and then we create the \"Acre\" score. \\nChallenges I ran into\\nThe frontend challenges were mainly UX oriented. We had  to figure out a way of presenting a lot of search options in a digestible way to not overwhelm the user, while being powerful enough to express a good enough interface to gain the fine grain of control we needed.\\nThe backend was another story -- having so many decision criteria with uneven weightings and for different people made things a real hassle. It was a significant challenge getting all the data together into a final result that made sense, for a wide variety of users.\\nAccomplishments that I\\'m proud of\\nWe are both happy to have achieved a simple, yet sophisticated app that can provide the user with real-time, real information results, based on THEIR career and lifestyle. \\nWhat I learned\\nWe gathered a few more skills on the front end side of things with React.js. But the biggest thing we learned was how to work with, acquire and empower an application with open data. \\nWhat\\'s next for Acre\\nWe are looking to explore the expansion of search criteria and improving algorithm efficiency and accuracy upon query.\\n',\n",

After several hours of discussion, we developed an integrated dental hygiene concept for household use. \\nWhat it does\\nTüth is an all-in-one, internet-enabled solution for the future of dental hygiene. It holds multiple toothbrushes in a UV sanitation bay. It automatically dispenses the perfect amount of tooth paste and mouthwash with its automated dispensing systems. It offers an integrated audio timer and responsive illumination system which is used to give the user feedback on their brushing time and ensure that they brush and mouthwash for the dentist-recommended time. The system supports the extension of multiple user profiles, enabling the system to tailor its dispersal amounts based on which toothbrush is picked up. The internet capability keeps the users accountable for their brushing habits. If one of the users forgets to brush a particular morning or night, it will post to their Twitter account, notifying the world that they forgot to brush their teeth --public shaming at its finest.\\nHow we built it\\nThe Tüth system was originally built using the Particle Photon board, providing wireless internet and easy access to web API's. During a momentary lapse of judgement in our sleep deprived state, we accidentally pumped 12v through the 5v board VIN pin, and that was the end of the Photon. Such is life. We ported the whole thing over to an Arduino Mega and wrote a Processing script on a laptop to rebuilt the twitter functionality.\\nWe had some servos and acrylic lying around and we scavenged for most of the other parts. We used a water bottle, pieces of scrap wood, and a lot of hot glue.\\nChallenges we ran into\\nIt was surprisingly hard to use a servo to control the mouthwash. We were too cheap to buy a real valve so we spent hours trying to design a way to crimp a tube to stop the flow.\\nThe Photon burnout cost us a tremendous amount of time in redesigning the electrical system and porting the code over.\\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\\nThe design prototype is fairly attractive considering how quickly it was put together.\\nWe had a ton of fun making it, and are glad we picked a fun project to work on.\\nWhat we learned\\nIt is incredibly rewarding to over-engineer a simple everyday task and apply the internet of things to ridiculous objects. \\nWhat's next for Tüth\\nWe've started prototyping a website interface that will hopefully allow users to track their brushing history.

While you're online, CopyCast will record HTTP requests to media, and allow you through a Browser Action dialog to send them to your Chromecast.\\nContent behind proprietary players (Adobe Flash, JWPlayer, etc) are all now castable! \\nIt Does FLV Video!\\nThere are a few extensions similar to CopyCast already on the market, but none of them are able to cast FLV because the Chromecast can not run it. CopyCast is able to play most FLV videos on popular sites to get content onto your TV ASAP.\\nHow Does it Cast FLV?!?!\\nOriginally, I was toying with a client side ASM.js build of ffmpeg to convert FLV videos on the fly (client side via a web worker) into mp4. This is technically feasible, however it was slow and defeated the entire point of CopyCast.\\nSo instead, CopyCast has an easy option to temporarilly spoof Chrome's User Agent on all outgoing HTTP requests to look like they were coming from an iPhone. For most sites that serve two primary things: television and advertisements, pretending to be a mobile user to grab the mp4 you want to cast works just fine :)\\nMost TV/Movie based streaming sites that serve FLV also serve mp4 if you ask them nice enough. This weird duality most likely can be attributed to the fact that mobile operating systems like iOS are much more locked down so even if a user is given an mp4 there's little the user could do short of watching it and moving along -- not anymore!\\nWhat Tech Did I Use (for HackWPI)\\n\\nChrome APIs \\n\\n\\n chrome.webRequest\\n chrome.webNavigation\\n chrome.tabs\\n\\nChromecast Library: chrome.cast\\nBootstrap\\njQuery\\n\\nFuture Plans\\nThis was a really fun project!

This includes:\\n\\nLocal Storage API - leveraging chrome.storage to persist data between sessions and even instances of your google account across Chrome Browsers would be really nice.\\n\\n\\nThis would also pave the way to features such as playlists, exporting, sharing, etc. \\n\\nIdeally, I'd ditch the whole approach with the user agent spoofing. At the time, the easiest way I see to do this is to abadnon \\n\\nConfiguration\\nYou need to add a file appid.js with the following\\nvar APP_ID = 'your id';\\nYou can obtain an app ID via the ChromeCast Developer Console.\\n\",\n",

One of our team members had a coach in high school who asked for an easier way to build lineups, preferably through technology. Her coach used to use popsicle sticks with magnets to figure out lineups. This application will take less time and it will be easier to determine which athlete is already in a boat, and which ones need to be added to a boat. \\nWhat it does\\nThis application allows coaches to register their teams and rosters, which eventually allows them to have a detailed user interface of a boat that they can choose (we have three different boats that have 8 seats). They will have oars (starboard and port - the two sides that rowers can be) as well as a microphone that represents the coxswain (there is one coxswain per boat). The coaches can then drag and drop each oar (that has each rowers name on it) onto a boat that is in the middle of the screen. One feature that it has is that it will grey out an oar if it is selected and dragged into a boat. This allows the coach to know which athletes are already selected to be in a boat.   \\nHow I built it\\nWe used android studio, with java, xml, and photoshop (creating visuals) to build this application.\\nChallenges I ran into\\nSome challenges we ran into were that none of us were extremely familiar with android studio, so it took more time to resolve errors and it took a while for our github to work.\\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\\nWe overcame many different challenges, while every group member had a different strengths and different backgrounds (two CS majors, one MIS major).\\nWhat I learned\\nHow to build an android application from scratch!\\nWhat's next for The Perfect Lineup\\nWe would like to eventually make it available for all sports, this would be a great tool for every sports coach to use!\\n\",\n",

You can only register, login, logout, upload a profile picture,write a post, change information about yourself and change password so far. Therefore, the functionality of adding friends and messaging each other does not work, because two days were not enough for that, but I am planning to continue to work on this project.\\nHow I built it\\nI used HTML and CSS for the Design and PHP for the server-side programming. For the database I used MySQL and phpMyAdmin of the website www.test-demo.com. I needed to use a lot of external sources, because it was my first time using PHP and MySQL. I watched a lot of videos on youtube and read a lot on different php websites to understand how to connect a website and a database. \\nChallenges I ran into\\nTime. I understand now that it is impossible to make a social networking website in two days, because I have not slept half an hour during the hackathon and I still could not finish it, or maybe it was because I was wasting a lot of time looking for functions of mysql and searching how to use php.\\nMy index.php code got deleted 2 times and I had to rewrite it. I was very angry and I wanted to give up so much after 2nd deletion, but I felt bad that I worked so hard and there was only one deletion, so I tried to fix it.

       " {'description': '\\nWhat\\'s the main idea?\\nTrivia Tour is a location based scavenger hunting app. Some people have compared to a modernized (yet greatly improved) version of geocaching. Users will be able to browse the built in \"package store\" and download their own adventures. Each package will have a set of locations that the user must reach. How the package takes you there, however, is up to its creator. The package could take you and your friends on a sightseeing tour, it could take you and your class on a educational trip, or it could take you and your date on a romantic hide and seek journey through a big city. The package will tell you where to start and then it will guide you from checkpoint to checkpoint. For example, maybe you want to learn about the history of Worcester. Simply download an educational package centered around Worcester and the app will take you on a tour, telling you where to go, then pausing at each predefined landmark to explain what you are looking at. Another example of possible use is during NSO at WPI. WPI would create a free package that would guide you throughout the entire campus, stopping you in front of certain buildings to explain what they are and what their significance is. Lastly, and perhaps my favorite example, Trivia Tour can make for a perfect first date. A package creator can lead a couple on a romantic scavenger hunt date. At each stop they receive a clue so that they must work together and use to find the next stop.\\nMore technical parts / about the app:\\nSo the obvious question now is: where are all these \"packages\" coming from? Well, the packages can be created by anyone! Anyone can become a developer and design their own unique packages with as many stops, clues, and hints as they like! This feature is actually mostly functioning and can be at tested (very beta, don\\'t judge!) at http://users.wpi.edu/~jtfakult/public/TriviaTour/create_package/. All created packages will be downloaded formatted as a json. The user then only has to upload the file to the server where it will be encrypted, modified and polished until it\\'s sparkly clean and ready to enter the package store. The app itself is already able to connect to the server and download packages. However, the search functionality of the store is not yet completed, so browsing isn\\'t possible. There is still a lot of work to be done, but the more I work, the more gems I find hidden within the idea.\\nWhy did I make it?\\nTwo reasons. First, I want people to have another fun game that they can play. But unlike many, this game is interactive. It causes them to think, learn, laugh, and even go outside and exercise. Second, I want people to share their cool ideas, pictures, riddles, and maybe their secret romantic side. I want the developers to have just as much fun with the app as the users. I want developers to also be users, and users to also be developers. It can be a truly social, friendly, and fun community.\\nAny future plans?\\nToo many. One feature I definitely want to add is having picture based clues rather than text based clues. This would allow developers to be more creative, as well as produce simplistic yet entertaining content for users. I also have been toying with the idea of a point system. Pretty simple really: the more puzzles you solve, the more points you get. Maybe some days I could even design my own special event package that people can download and score even more points with. I also want to make the developer interface extremely simple: encourage developers with the ease of work. Also, maybe a better name for the app wouldn\\'t be a bad idea... but I\\'m not sure yet. It would definitely be awesome if WPI ran with my NSO idea: I personally would have found it very cool to have a resource like that while I was learning the ropes. Then I also had the thought that teachers could use it to take attendance. Not sure how feasible that is though. The list goes on. The app has so many uses I can\\'t explain it in a short bit of writing like this. I\\'m really excited to see where it could go.\\n',\n",

However, due to the high price of commercial CCTV cameras costing upwards of 250 dollars, many household can only afford one camera which is barely enough to cover a single room in a normal flat. Therefore, we decided to create a system which is low cost and ensures that a single camera can be used for surveillance throughout the entire house. And this of course led to us being inspired to build phobe.\\nWhat it does\\nPhobe basically uses the Roomba system and IR sensors to navigate around the house. This allows for a camera to roam around the house autonomously detecting unknown obstacles or people.

If we were to prepare certain food for our guests, we need to know what they prefer or what they cannot eat. Some of us are vegetarian, while some of us prefer local food. Thus we create this application to allow people to know whether the food that they are cooking will be suitable for their guests. Also, it allows people to interconnect by knowing the different type of food available around the world, with people enjoying the food cooked suited to their preferences.\\nWhat it does\\nUsers are able to view and create recipe that will be approved by the admin first. Users that are able to view the different recipe will have a choice to choose their own filter (e.g Halal, Vegetarian, Local) to sort out the recipe accordingly to this filters. After which, they are able to follow a step-by-step guideline to help them in cooking properly with the right ingredients and ensure that the taste will be right.\\nHow we built it\\nWe use Eclipse to create a web-prototype to show how the app will look like. The languages used are briefly javascript, css, php and html. We also use it with the database such as phpmyadmin and mysqli. The photos are edited with Adobe Photoshop.\\nChallenges we ran into\\nWe didn't have much experience in building a webpage and we had a lot of difficulties such as properly aligning the elements together or having the elements display as we wanted too. We also had trouble understanding the javascript codes as we do not have much experience with the different languages. Despite of the lack in experience, our team persevered.\\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\\nWe are not that experienced with our tools as this tools are briefly learn in our school. We are really proud that we could create this webpage within a short time and learn a lot of new skills.\\nWhat we learned\\nWe learned how to photoshop, how to tint the images to a dark color. We also managed to learn how to incorporate with different elements together to make the website work with the database.\\nWhat's next for Let'sCook\\nWe are planning to incorporate more social elements into the website such as ratings, commenting, 'liking'. We aim to make Let'sCook into a community-based website. Furthermore, we wish to sell this website to supermarket chains that have home delivery services. Specifically, users will be able to directly place their orders to supermarket chains to conveniently purchases the ingredients of the particular recipe from the chosen supermarket. In other words, we hope to create a B2C platform. \\n\",\n",

This is to encourage children to throw their litter into the bins. At the same time, the amount of trash in the bin will be automatically detected and printed it out on a lcd display in terms of low, medium and high.\\nHow we built it\\nThe sensor we use is a ultrasonic sensor which will help detect the amount of trash that is left in the bin. The ultrasonic sensor emits sounds wave which will travel and bounces back when it hits an object/wall. The timing of the sound wave traveled through and from will determine the distance between the sensor and the object/wall. If the distance is getting lower and lower it will determine that the trash in the bin is almost full, while if the distance is still high, it will determine that the trash in the bin is still empty or low in trash. \\nAnother sensor we use is a touch sensor, which will act as a trigger, such that when the touch sensor is being touch it will automatically trigger a buzzer which will buzz to the tune of the star wars imperial march and the led lights will blink to the beat of the tune. which will be entertaining and attractive to the children when they throw their rubbish into the bin. \\nChallenges we ran into\\nThe coding of the tune for the buzzer cannot be easily found, we have to go through a series of try and errors when coding the function as we have to calibrate the beat of the tune into coding terms.  \\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\\nWe end up being able to tune the buzzer to buzz a short verse of the theme song from star wars named the imperial march.\\nWhat we learned\\nWe learn to calibrate and modify the code for the buzzer for it to play a tune as accurately as possible to the imperial march theme.  \\nWhat's next for annoyingly smart dustbin\\nSending the data of the capacity in which the rate of rubbish generated to the cloud.\\nThe data generated from the ultrasonic sensor in the bin can be use to notify the cleaners of any surrounding bins that are nearly full.\\n\",\n",

You upload it to the cloud, you get a URL, you get the email address of your friend or find his Facebook, you message him. That's a hell lot of friction for something so simple.\\nWhat we built is a tool for nearby file sharing through audio. You drag and drop a file you want to upload, and all nearby computers get prompted to download it. While developing this, we even started using our MVP to share assets between each other, accelerating our development workflow and proving how effective of a tool this can be. \\nWhat it does\\nIt provides a convenient platform for users to send files to nearby computers AND mobile devices through playing a series of tones. The nearby devices receiving the tones will automatically initiate file download.\\nHow we built\\nIt is using a web application and using Javascript to control the broadcast and receive different frequencies. The uploader will upload the file to our python Flask server which will respond with an address to retrieve the file. Then the uploading device will broadcast the address in form of sound waves that will be picked up by nearby receiving devices and will initiate file transfer.\\nChallenges we ran into\\nWe mostly ran into problems related to the amount of noise our sound wave experience as well as the limitations commercial hardware and compatibility. Our frequency analyser is very sensitive to noises and can easily be disturbed by other sounds. Furthermore, commercial microphones are designed to broadcast and pickup frequency ranges around 2000-3000 Hz, and cannot accurately determine higher frequency ranges.\\nAccomplishments\\nWe're proud of being able to work together and overcome many of the challenges described above. The project was more difficult than we had anticipated. We used heuristics to filter out noises and use statistical methods to increase the probability of picking up the right signals. Because of the high chance of incorrect information transfer, we minimized the amount of sound waves sent. There are a lot of things to improve upon and Howl is far from perfect, but we believe we did create a product that facilitates the transfer of files between devices or group of people.\\nWhat we learned\\nWe learned (about ¼ way into the hackathon) that Google has attempted a similar project involving Google plugin for transferring urls between different chrome browsers through sound wave. At the point we were just starting to realize the difficulty associated with receiving sound waves accurately in a noisy environment. Our early attempts at transferring sound waves were disastrous. However, from this process, we learned a lot about the technical aspects of transmitting information through sound waves, and experienced first-hand just how the same pitch can sound different from just 2 feet away.\\nWhat's next for Howl\\nWe want to give users the ability to share not only files, but URL's as well. We also plan on building a Chrome Extension, allowing the functionality to be independent of a website and can upload from any web page.\\n\",\n",

We broke Clarifai down into an equation: Picture + Clarifai = Tags. So why not flip that equation on its head and use tags to \"create\" a picture? Through the use of descriptive tags, Iris aurally illustrates a scene in the minds of the blind. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words.\\nWe also wanted to challenge ourselves to create an app that could be easily used by the visually impaired. By simply opening the app and sliding your device into your breast pocket with the camera peeking out, you\\'re ready to go. Controls are simple with the Myo wristband, which enables the blind to interact with our app in a meaningful way.\\nIris is a novel marriage of software and hardware, and we\\'re excited for you to give it a try!\\nWhat it does\\nIris is an application built to help those who can’t see, experience vision in a new way. With a simple gesture, Iris captures an image and gathers data about the image. Then, this information is spoken directly to the user, without any physical interaction with the device.\\nHow we built it\\nIris peeks out of the user’s breast pocket, waiting until needed. Using the Myo armband, the user makes a fist to capture an image through Iris. The image is saved on the device and analyzed using the Clarifai API asynchronously. When the API returns information about the image, Android’s text to speech functionality is used to read the attributes of the image to the user.\\nChallenges we ran into\\nMost of the challenges we faced were because of the many asynchronous threads required to make Iris function. The camera, Clarifai API, text to speech, and loading screen all run separate threads, making it extremely difficult to implement them all at once. When working with the camera, we had to get around using the built in camera software by using Android’s hardware camera. The issue with this is that it is asynchronous, and we also have to handle raw image data, using byte streams and byte arrays. Our other significant issue was that the Myo armband became very unreliable at times, forcing us to recalibrate it before each use.\\nAccomplishments that we\\'re proud of\\nOur team is fairly new to asynchronous programming, and working on separate threads, so this entire project was a great challenge. We worked on having the calls to APIs asynchronously, as the APIs’ documentation suggested, however with only 6 hours left, we had an application that broke every time the async tasks finished in the wrong order. However, after a significant amount of refactoring, we were able to organize the application in a more efficient manner, making it fully functional and capable of helping those who need it. \\nWhat we learned\\nWe really learned a great deal about the less common sides of Android development. File manipulation, camera usage, and asynchronous task management, were among these aspects. As CS majors we usually do not dabble on the hardware side of things, so working with the armband was also a big learning experience for us.\\n',\n",

We will do this by requiring even less information from the seller and intelligently filling it out to the best we possibly can. Additionally, we are going to implement an image verification system that can decide whether or not a user is submitting an image of a book, and if not, it would report an error and remove the post.\\n\",\n",

These user's actual result will likely always be ESFP because of pressure to conform to social media and make yourself seem exciting. We've been running user tests for several hours before the end of the hackathon deadline and are noting observations when people comment that their actual Myers-Briggs and how they realize that their online personalities actually differ from their IRL personas.\\n\\n\\nWhat we learned\\nWe learned what is and isn't possible with image recognition AI and how to quickly shake off from past failures and pivot into new ideas based on what we learned.\\nWhat's next for InstaType\\nBigger and better analysis! New social media platforms! The possibilities are endless!\\n\",\n",

       " {'description': \"\\nInspiration\\nI realized that we have social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter however we really don't have social media that captures the spontaneous moments during your day. Whether it is a dance off, a pickup basketball game, a party on Greek Row, or a hackathon like this, people may want bigger turnouts for events like those however some people may not be aware of the events that are taking place around them. Likewise, people who host events may not know who is interested in their events. Not only can this application help fix this disconnect, it is also a form of social media that encourages real life interaction. \\nWhat it does\\nThis is an Android application that helps students connect with the events that are going on around them. The main interfaces are the map and the live feed of posts. On the map, students can walk anywhere on campus and look at a map which has pins that correspond to different events. Examples of events are pickup games, parties, study sessions, etc. Users can then click the pin and click 'yes' to show that they are interested in going to the event. On the live feed of posts, users can see the details of the event and also show that they are interested. Once they are at the event, they can also post pictures, videos and descriptions of the event for other users to see. This is great especially for events like parties on Thursday nights, if people want to see which parties are lively and seem like fun. The application also allows users to send private messages to other users and add profile pictures. There is also a score feature based on how many posts a user makes.\\nHow I built it\\nI built the application using Eclipse for Android applications. I used the Google Maps API for the map. I ran the application on a Samsung Galaxy S. Data was stored in Microsoft Azure and Parse. \\nChallenges I ran into\\nSome challenges I ran into were that there was a lot of code so there were a lot of debugging issues. Also, there were some data storage issues as a lot of data is being saved and retrieved from online hosting. \\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\\nI am proud that I was able to finish the application, and I think that it is something that I can try to bring to the University of Washington. It took a lot of work to finish so I am proud that I was able to stick with it. \\nWhat I learned\\nI learned that programming is both fun and stressful at the same time. However, just like anything else, it is important to just stick with what you are trying to do, and you will be able to finish what you set out to do. \\nWhat's next for Kronakon\\nI will try to improve on this application and try to get it to the level of a Facebook or Instagram application, in terms of design and capabilities.Once I get the application finalized and compatible for Android, Windows, and Apple devices, I will try to target a specific community for this application, and that community is Greek Row. I just signed Zeta Beta Tau last quarter and I think this is the best place to start because many events take place in this area. Once I can get a solid group of users, I am hoping to get the application to all parts of campus. There are so many ways to expand on the user group for the application; for example, restaurant owners who want people to know that they are having their weekly special for a discounted price, could post their event on the app. People in the library who want to have bigger study groups can post on the application. Stores who are having discounts on their merchandise can even post on the app. All in all, there are high hopes for the future of Kronakon and hopefully reality will meet expectation!\\n\",\n",

After attending the workshop held by Clarifai about machine learning with their API. We just had to use this technology to make something amazing. After studying it and seeing potential for its facial recognition, we had the idea to make this app.\\nWhat it does\\nOur app, Twinder, analyzes an inputted picture by the user and searches among other users to find potential lookalikes. It returns the user's lookalike potentially allowing the user to find them and form a clone army!\\nHow we built it\\nThis application utilizes the Clarifai API to analyze inputted images and tag the photo with words that describe the image. Using this, we cross analyzed these tags with other tags in our database and narrowed down to find the lookalike of the user. Our algorithm also calculates the percentage likeness of the users to give the user an idea of how accurate the hack is!\\nChallenges we ran into\\nWe came across many issues while attempting to build this hack. We changed languages multiple times trying to find a way to implement both back end and front end development in such a way so that everybody could contribute to the project. We finally came down to using PHP and jQuery and the hack came out to be successful.\\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\\nThis project was as a whole an accomplishment we are all proud of. We came in with no ideas for a hack, with different skill sets that we thought would mismatch, and no plans to be a team. Rather than being a setback, all these things came together and everybody's different experiences helped us advance this hack to the next level.\\nWhat we learned\\nThis hackathon was a great learning experience for us, we learned to work as a team and a few new languages alone the way. PHP was a brand new language for half of us and it turned out to be something we plan to implement in future projects.\\nWhat's next for Twinder\\nThe future of Twinder is vast. We are hoping that with each advancement of Clarifai's API, we can further improve the reliability and accuracy of Twinder's facial comparison. We also want to increase our database to allow users to compare to celebrities, among Facebook friends, and as many more inputs as we could possibly find. Other possible improvements we were hoping to make in the future is to allow the users to communicate and meet up once they find each other.\\nThe domain we purchased for the domain.com challenge was whyuhefftobemad.com, but domain.com did not process it on time\\n\",\n",

With more data, we can refine our AI and offer even more precise result. Including other area than Montreal is also high on our list.\\nThere are so many open API that provide information on real estate property and their surrounding.

The purpose of the application is to act as a medium between people who are looking for someone to do a small one time job such as helping them move, lawn care, dog sitting, babysitting, tutoring, and many more jobs with people who are offering those services. Another goal of the application is to be community driven, meaning users will rate each other when one provides a job for the other. The person seeking someone for a job will create a post with details about what the job is, the expected price, date, and the duration and then other people who can fulfill that service at the specified time will bid against other people. The job provider will then be able to view each bidders profile and the rate they offered and then pick who they want to fulfill their service. \\nTechnology\\nThe application was developed using the Ionic hybrid mobile application framework for Cordova, so web technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript with AngularJs were used to develop the application. Instead of developing a backend and setting up a database we decided to use Parse, which is a mBAAS. This allowed us to simply do the data access from the front-end and then letting Parse handle querying and storing the data.\\nChallenges\\nThe scope of the project was really large and we knew this going in so not all essential features were fully developed. \\nThe Future\\nWe are considering working on this project after the Hackathon to continue developing it as a team. We believe that our application could have potential. Although, there is competition out there that provides a similar experience to our application, they have shortcomings and/or are not widely used by the public.\\n',\n",

That left the two remaining members to brainstorm our idea. Our initial idea was to make a large program with many different features, but many of them required more knowledge of connectivity between languages than we knew. After throwing around a few school-related ideas, we settled on our current idea that assists with notes based classes. \\nWhat it does\\nOur program takes facts in a plain text document and turns them into questions to study. Many keywords in the sentence are replaced with the appropriate question words to create as many questions from the fact as there are keywords. These questions can be retrieved from the output file or can be studied using a simple GUI.\\nHow we built it\\nThe GUI is written in MATLAB, and calls API from Mathematica and our Java classes in order to run. The personalNotes class reads in a .txt file with a list of facts, each on a new line, and generates an ArrayList for each fact. These questions are, when not using the GUI, written to an output file in the format of the question text immediately followed by the answer on a new line.\\nTo generate the list of questions, the static method toQuestion is called with a fact as a parameter. This fact is parsed into an ArrayList of individual words in the fact. The method then goes through each word and, if it is a question word as per the rules (see gallery), will create a Question object with the question and answer and add it to the ArrayList that will be returned. This repeats until the entire fact has been parsed.\\nFinally, MATLAB calls the personalNotes main method after setting an input and output file. The Java code runs as described above while Mathematica processes answers typed into the GUI and evaluates their natural-language interpretation (so that, for example, NYC can be interpreted as New York City). Then MATLAB takes the output file from the Java code and uses it to display questions in a short-answer quiz format.\\nChallenges we ran into\\nThere were a number of challenges we encountered along the way. When initially working on this project, we had very large ambitions. For example, we wanted to be able to store and organize facts as well as classify the facts and questions into themes. Upon suggestion that the scope was too large, we narrowed it down to its current state.\\nWe also encountered unsolved issues with turning facts into questions. Initially, the grammar in the outputted questions would be bad enough to render the question incomprehensible. Even after we fixed the problem, often, a question will be understandable, but not quite proper (for example, \"in when the Civil War started?\", is a possible question). Other times it will not be possible for us to know whether a question requires either a who/what or a when/how many. In this case, we have to provide both, leading to more strange phrasings. \\nAnother problem was that during the majority of the time, we were only working on one Java class. This made it difficult for all four members to work on different sections. We were able to solve this using Saros, which allowed multiple people to alter the code at once. However, this was only a partial solution for Saros was unreliable when connecting more than 2 laptops.\\nAccomplishments that we\\'re proud of\\nWe are proud that we were able to work together and have the code work well within 2 days. Our teamwork contributed to our success and it allowed us to have better communication. This lead to a decrease in stress and increase in work productivity. \\nWe also managed to create a fairly consistent set of rules which are able to output useful and understandable study questions. These rules, while not complete and sometimes with exceptions, effectively allow us to find simple facts in statements without teaching our program english grammar.\\nIn addition, we learned how to make a GUI in MATLAB that was effective enough to fluently display many questions. Before this weekend, we had almost no knowledge of GUIs (besides very basic Java GUI understanding). Our proficiency of GUIs will be helpful in the future as well.\\nWhat\\'s next for Class\\nIn the future, we would like to both improve on current features and implement additional ones. First, we would like to improve on our rules for finding key words in the question so we would not need to use terms such as \"who/what\". In addition, we could improve the rules so that the questions are grammatically correct.\\nIn terms of extra features, our highest priority goals are to implement a multiple choice mode with additional choices taken from other proper nouns in the notes and an ability to star questions to study again later. Another goal is to increase the usability of the GUI as well as making one through Java and MATLAB. \\nThe Name \"Class\"\\nWe choose the name Class because it sits in the intersection between school (class rooms) and computer science (classes in programs). \\n',\n",

In addition, it\\'s often necessary to manage a server on the go, and given that text messages don\\'t require a Wi-Fi connection, they\\'re the perfect way to make sure that we could have access to our server 24/7.\\nWhat it does\\nOur python project listens for a text message (through a dedicated SMTP email server) then reads and parses the email to get a bash command.  Then it creates a subprocess to run the bash command on the server\\'s shell.  It also includes two factor authentication, with a config file and a required usage password.\\nHow I built it\\nWe wrote 3 python scripts and used an IMAP library to create a running Python daemon to listen for bash commands.\\nChallenges I ran into\\nIt was difficult to change directory, since processes terminated after a single command, but we decided to store the directory and track changes.  Error handling with incorrect commands was also difficult, since error messages have different formatting.\\nAccomplishments that I\\'m proud of\\nThe python script is extremely fast, and took relatively little code to write, given the fact that it can run almost any one line bash command.\\nWhat I learned\\nWe learned how to spawn subprocesses, route text messages through email, and in general, how to use python\\'s massive standard library to accomplish tasks far more difficult with other languages.\\nWhat\\'s next for SSH over SMS\\nThe next step is support two line commands and commands that require interaction, such as \"sudo\".  In the future, we\\'d like to make it possible to conduct even more complex operations over text.\\n',\n",

However, the content we can identify with the most is what is most relevant to our current stage in life. Content discovery services out there just don't capture this. What if there were a discovery service that would reveal to us new things based on where we are on our personal journey...\\nWhat it does\\nPicktureThis is a photo-based music discovery service. Given a photo, PicktureThis will find a Spotify playlist perfect for the scene. The ideal version of PicktureThis would be a mobile app, where the user can capture a moment they are currently experiencing, and be catered a personalized music experience for that moment. PicktureThis is currently implemented as a web-app as a proof-of-concept.\\nHow we built it\\nGiven a photo, we use Clarita's API to perform object and scene recognition. We then get a list of tags related to the photo. This list of tags is then mapped to 132 music genres using word vector similarity calculations. We used Google's word2vec word vector library to compute similarity between tags and genres. We select the genre that best matches the photo, and find a Spotify playlist in that genre using Spotify's API.\\nChallenges we ran into\\nMany Many challenges with getting things set up, especially with installing python packages and setting up the website on Azure. We also had trouble conceptualizing how to find songs given photo tags. It was only after scouring through countless music APIs and realizing the limited search capability they provide did we think of using word vectors. Other challenges were neither of us had much experience programming web apps. There was a lot of learning on the go and troubleshooting, but it was well worth it!\\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\\nWe are very proud that we were able to get a web-app working. We could imagine that if this app were further developed it would be useful to many people. As a user you can compound on new experiences with new music, and the convenience of photo-based song discovery is definitely very appealing. For example, looking for new yoga music? Just take a picture of your class and a new playlist will be handpicked for you.\\nWhat we learned\\nWe learned a lot about web development, getting environments set up, doing API calls, a little bit about word vectors, and developed a lot of patience.\\nWhat's next for PicktureThis\\nPicktureThis would be great as a mobile app. If we can have it interface with photo-sharing apps like Instagram then it would be even more useful to people. Also, music is only the beginning. PicktureThis can extend to catering movies, short films, poetry, art, books... With the rapid advancement of object and scene recognition technology, it will become more and more easy to discover content we can connect deeply with.\\n\",\n",

       " {'description': '\\nInspiration\\nThis project was inspired by Intuitive Machine\\'s Terrestrial Return Vehicle (TRV) TRaVeller spacecraft, and the suggested project statement to \"let a user know if TRV is visible from their current location.\" The TRV is an automated precision return vehicle, designed to deliver a scientific payload to a Low Earth Orbit (and beyond) and autonomously re-enter the Earth\\'s atmosphere for a safe, precision landing. The initial idea was to create an Android application based on the open source Google Sky Map project, allowing users to explore the current location of the TRV on their mobile devices -- an augmented reality window of the night sky.\\nWe also sat in the Google Cloud Platform workshop at HackRice and learned how to use Firebase to build real-time web applications, which was incorporated into the project\\'s cloud infrastructure.\\nWhat it does\\nSpacecraft-Spotter is a web application that utilizes real telemetry data from the TRV to map its position in a simulated sky, allowing users to locate the vehicle in their own sky overhead as it makes its way home from the International Space Station. It was built to help people learn more about the TRV spacecraft and to interactively follow its mission in an engaging manner.\\nHow we built it\\nThe web app runs on a virtual server on the Google Cloud Platform. The frontend web interface was built with HTML, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, and Underscore.js. Backend cloud services were provided by Firebase, which hosted the static site and its data content. Geolocation API\\'s from Google Maps and freegeoip were used to determine a user\\'s location based on their IP address. Alternatively, the user can specify a different city or custom latitude/longitude. With this information, Stellarium (a planetarium software) can generate a simulated view of the sky from that location, showing exactly what you would see when you look up at the stars. This 180-degree FOV view was then exported to a PNG image.\\nIntuitive Machines provided a CSV file of simulated telemetry data of a TRV landing from the ISS to Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. This CSV file contained over 200,000 data entries for various TRV characteristics including mission time, sensor states, propellant and engine statuses, velocity/acceleration, attitude quaternions, and more. A Python script utilized NumPy data structures to parse and manipulate the CSV data to determine the TRV\\'s latitude, longitude, altitude, and flight path angle. A calculated transformation was done to map the spacecraft\\'s lat/long coordinates into the user\\'s sky perspective at a discrete timestep. A further transformation was done with ImageMagick to overlay an image of the TRV onto the Stellarium image, incorporating the spacecraft\\'s position in the sky, flight path angle, and altitude. The TRV image rotates over time corresponding to the flight path, and the closer it gets to landing, the bigger it appears on the sky map.\\nThe output overlay image is then displayed back on the web interface. An extra feature was added to \"animate\" the flight by generating overlayed images at discrete timesteps and displaying them in sequential order.\\nChallenges we ran into\\nWe ran into several challenges throughout this project. As a demo, the web application was functional, but not optimized for performance. The largest bottleneck on latency was due to having to run the Stellarium software locally on the server. We could not find a good, open web API to generate an image of the sky based on the user\\'s location. So, we had to settle with an offline solution of Stellarium.\\nIt also took some time to fully interpret the telemetry data in the CSV file. Parsing the information is one task, but manipulating the data to ensure proper unit conversions and coordinate system transformations proved to be non-trivial. A less-than-ideal workaround was used to position the spacecraft into the sky image; it may not be 100% accurate, but it\\'s good enough to display a landing pattern that can deceive the untrained eye.\\nAccomplishments that we\\'re proud of\\nHackRice 2016 was both of our first hackathons, so we\\'re proud to have gone through the experience (and to actually submit a project). We were fairly late in the game when we settled on this idea, so it was very rewarding to collaborate and see the project come alive. We were just a team of two this time around, but just imagine what we could do with a team of three!\\nThis was also Rohit\\'s first Node.js application!\\nWhat we learned\\nA lot! Both of us worked with new technologies and API\\'s that we were previously unfamiliar with. We learned about Firebase and the Google Cloud Platform that same day from a locally-hosted seminar. We also learned about autonomous spacecraft landings, astronomy, celestial coordinates, and how MLH works.\\nWhat\\'s next for spacecraft-spotter\\nThere are so many more features that we could add to improve the functionality and performance of this project. Although it was fun to build, it is unlikely that we will revisit it. We live in different cities, and Rohit is finishing up his last semester of school!\\nMisc.\\nHieu met Rohit at a shuttle stop in the visitors parking lot at Rice University in Houston, TX. They had both driven several hours from other cities (Hieu from Austin, Rohit from Arlington), and arrived on campus around 7pm to attend HackRice 2016. Both were completely lost, but managed to find their way to the hackathon with the help of three friendly Rice students. There, they shared a table together, discussing potential project ideas. Intuitive Machines was one of the hackathon\\'s sponsors offering a special prize for working with their data set. With no other exciting prospective projects in mind, we went to work.\\nFin.\\n',\n",

We had to embed code to input the equation editor.\\nChallenges I ran into\\nIt was difficult embedding equation editor on the website using JavaScript so that students have a space to write their math equations.\\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\\nWe were proud of the work we did by building the website and because we know that we are helping students to do their homework, which we all have had trouble with in the past.\\nWhat I learned\\nI learned that I really need to keep coding because it will help me speed up the work during Hackathon. We also learned how to embed an equation editor into our page.\\nWhat's next for Am Help!\\nThe next is making this website look realistic by building an App that can be useful for school because many students would want to access this site using their phones.  We also need to make the submission and response features functional so that the project starts to work.  We ran out of time to build a full working product, but with more time, we would be able to add submission and chat features.\\n\",\n",

Hence, the birth of Pictouresque.\\nWhat it does; The app allows users to take pictures of their surroundings and get an informative audio tour (featuring bites of information about what's in the picture).\\nHow we built it; The app was built using Java and Android-studio.\\nChallenges we ran into; We ran into a few issues while coding the app. First of all we did not realize that picture recognition software is still in primitive stages. Instead of making our own camera, we used an existing API to scan instead of take a picture, and then compare that scan to a library of buildings.\\nAccomplishments that we're proud of; We're proud of having been able to work effectively with people we had just met. We're proud of the progress we made on the app, the information and research we gathered, and the design of our name, logo, and presentation. Being able to add our own creative flair makes the project completely ours.\\nWhat we learned; The importance of diversity on a team! We have a computer science student, a computer engineering student, a mechanical engineering student, an economics and political science student, and an M.B.A. student, which allowed us to divide the work according to individual strengths.\\nWhat's next for Pictouresque; We hope to grow the user-base so that users can generate information for attractions they visit. Our aim is to allow other users to vote for their favorite bites, and the most popular bites will be generated for users seeking information about that specific attraction. We also hope to create a feature that points users to nearby attractions, and connect to social media accounts to share about their experiences.\\n\",\n",

       " {'description': '\\n##Inspiration\\nOur inspiration for the project stemmed from the fact that everyone in our group were self-described introverts. Thus, we wanted to make an app that would be a comprehensive database event listings that people could attend if they so wish to do so. The name Evencial came from combining the words \"Event\" and \"Social.\"\\n## What it does\\nThe app lets people sign in through Facebook, therein automatically integrating one\\'s Facebook profile into their Evencial profile. They can then find events through 3 settings: University, Local, and Private. University events are, ideally, events one can only find after registering and signing up with their official university ID. The events would also be only created by university officials. Local events are events that can be found around you within a certain mile radius that you assign. Private events are events that users can create and invite their friends where no other people would be able to find these events unless they were also invited. Moreover, there is a Search feature for people to find events based on categories, such as Hackathons, music festivals, and other functions. The app also has the feature of showing the user a map with pinpoints that indicate ongoing events near them in the area. They can also set privacy settings on the app where only friends that send them requests, which they accept, will be able to see them and their profile on the app. This app lets people connect and follow their friends and favorite celebrities to whichever event they choose to go to. It allows people to go out of their comfort zone and make friends. Not only does this app help people, but it is also philanthropic in the sense that people can find charity events to attend and volunteering events to join. A fun feature about the app is that, when people join, they have the choice to make their profile picture as an animal. As the person attends more and more events, they will automatically be upgraded to older versions of the animal. An example of this, and our personal favorite, is when a person starts out as a caterpillar. As they attend more events, they eventually become a \"social butterfly.\" In addition to the aforementioned option, another feature is the ability to earn badges and stickers as people attend more events and host them. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the uniqueness of the app is encompassed by the fact that it is tailored specifically to the user. The app, once the user is registered, asks them to take a short survey to subsequently suggest events to the user based on interest. The app will gather data on the user throughout the course of the app\\'s use to suggest more accurate and interesting events. It will, additionally, send notifications to the user regarding said interesting events. The target demographic for this app circumscribes all ages since people at all stages of life can use this app.The overall encompassing goal of the app is to connect people, regardless of age, to events that interest them where they can also meet people that share the same interest in an easy and efficient manner through the use of this app. \\n## How we built it\\nWe built the app using Ionic and our skills in Java, HTML, and CSS. Skills we taught ourselves over the past 2 days include Ionic, how to use Angular JavaScript, and learning about APIs.\\n## Challenges we ran into\\nThe biggest challenge of the app was having it connect to Facebook through the login feature. \\n## Accomplishments that we\\'re proud of\\nAlthough we did not manage to fully integrate the app with Facebook, we did manage to get the login feature of Facebook to show up on the app, which was a big accomplishment for us. Making the whole app, in a sense, was also an accomplishment since this was the first time that the people in our group collaborated to make an app.\\n## What we learned\\nWe learned that making an app is a multi-step process that involves a lot of forethought. We also learned more about Ionic, the Facebook API, Angular JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. She Innovates helped us improve on our communication skills with each other, and we managed to create an app due to this. \\n## What\\'s next for Evencial\\nWe plan to complete making Evencial so that it can become its own app and be sent into the market for general usage. We would have to fix any problems with it and improve the app visually. Our ultimate goal is to connect people who do not usually go outside and attend public gatherings, and we also wish to connect people that hope to help the community and bring them together. \\n',\n",

The Muse communicates over Bluetooth to a Muse provided input diver (in this case for Windows) which acts as a client and connects over UDP to our server.\\n2) Our OSC server monitors the streams passing along this socket connection and isolates data of interest. This includes a value indicating the probability of muscle movement around the forehead and eyes - our most reliable metric for input at this time. We also have a few theoretical models that interpret EEG data without relying on muscle contractions of any type, and, with some calibration we have have limited success translating this data into codeable inputs. However, the lengthy calibration requirement as well as the general unpredictability of these models did not meet our needs for an intuitive and accessible device and thus remain a project for future development.\\n3) The OSC server interprets this data and they relays that interpretation via a Tornado server, through websockets, to a web frontend. We chose a web frontend over a client side GUI for two chief reasons: from a project management perspective, web development was much easier to isolate from the hardware and sever development allowing us to better work concurrently during the hackathon; from a design perspective, web development + our python stack makes us readily cross-platform in a way that many OS-specific GUI libraries do not.\\n4) The web GUI displays an array of values to the user and iterates through them in a predictable way - allowing the user to first select a column, and then a row of values from a 6*6 grid. This type of input is easily learned and relatively self-explanatory which means that users can start communicating right away.\\nChallenges we ran into\\nOur original plan was to build a device that would convert EEG readings to Morse Code based on K-Means clustering. It was not long until we realized this was not a viable strategy. In addition to neither of us having a background in Morse Code - a highly timing-sensitive protocol that isn't easily interpreted by computers to begin with - finding two distinct clusters amid the noise generated by our brains proved impossible. In general, the information monitored by the Muse headband seems better suited to recognizing overall states (such as drowsiness) than to isolating snap deviations in thought patterns.\\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\\nDespite these setbacks, we remain proud of the fact that our core objective - making it cheaper and easier for paralyzed individuals to communicate with friends and loved ones - was more or less met. The chief reason for this was our ability to devise a reliable, unary input protocol that averages a rate of 1 character every three seconds (comparable with many commercial devices, even without accounting for the predictive text modeling). Although this realization was more the result of a serendipitous recollection of a story about POWs who communicated using a similar scheme during Vietnam than the result of any particular insight on our parts, we feel strongly that it is one of the better ways to key input into a machine with use of only one (and in this case, virtual) button. \\nWhat we learned\\nDespite it not making its way into the final project, we learned a great deal about big data analytics (most of our models needed to wrestle with millions of data points in four+ dimensions) .\\nOur sense of UI design was also pushed in new ways as we struggled with devising a user interface that could accept complex information from a user without the use of either a keyboard or mouse.\\nWhat's next for TypeFace\\nPerhaps more so than any other hackathon project we've completed, we'd like to ensure that this one has a future. Not only was it a blast to code, but we also hope that it might make someone's life easier or at least inspire someone better at EEG interpretation and biohacking than us to push this frontier forward.\\nFor the remaining hours of the hackathon we will be continuing to work with our data modeling algorithms so maybe there'll be a surprise EEG-only option by the time demos start!\\n\",\n",

       " {'description': \"\\nInspiration\\nRecently the world has been going through a lot of disasters. Some natural and the other man-made. Some people unite at these times but are unable to manage their will to help. Twitter has been really helpful in making this happen. However, this activity is not managed properly and many times tasks are overlooked or are looked by many people at once. Example: In Chennai Floods, many people tweeted about the help they required, however, sometimes the help was not given or was given by 2 sets of people. The motivation is to do a 1 to 1 matching of people who want to help and people who are in need of help with no conflicts and better management.\\nWhat it does\\nIt takes in twitter data for particular HashTags and creates a stream classifying relief required into various categories. Currently the categories are predefined. But intelligent systems can be used to mature the set of categories in the future. Each relief request is converted into a task which can be seen by everyone in the form of tabular format. Once someone takes up a task, they are given 1 day to work on it and if they are unable to finish the task, their trust level decreases. Once they complete the task, their trust level increases. This ensures that no task is taken by multiple users and that no task is overlooked. \\nHow I built it\\nWe built the application on HTML and used firebase for Database. We used twitter API to get all the relief request, for login purpose and also for showing tweets from a particular hash tag in real time. We also used Facebook login API for alternate login. We used Spark and Kafka for natural language processing and classification of tweets.  \\nWe started by dividing tasks on various levels, like database, frontend and backend. Then as the app kept going we kept taking up tasks and working on it. We used slack for communicating important information and API keys.\\nChallenges I ran into\\nThe main challenge was to be able to built a working application using new technologies in such sort span of time. But that was the fun of it too. Hence we love hackathons ;) :P . \\nSince none of us had worked on UI, we faced quite some challenges on that end as well.\\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\\nTo be able to come here even after having so many assignments' overhead ;)\\nFrankly it would be to able to mock about how we were pathetic at different aspects, still overcoming them and coming up with an awesome app which has a scope of lot of improvements and can help people. \\nWhat I learned\\nWe learned that what makes a great app is an awesome and nobel idea and its not so difficult to built on a new technology. You always end up learning from them.\\nWhat's next for Rescue Rangers\\nThere is a lot to our Rescue Rangers in the future.\\n\\nClassification of twitter data is not matured enough. We can do a lot of natural language processing to eliminate rumours and classify data on the basis of tasks\\nTasks are not prioritized currently, however we are various algorithms in mind to prioritize. \\na. On the basis of keywords(Emergency, SOS)\\nb. On the basis of upvotes given by humans(Sometimes computer is unable to understand exact sentiment of a request)\\nCurrently we determine the trust level on the basis of tasks taken by the user. We are not sure about whether the task is completed. We can have a mechanism of assuring that task marked completed is completed.\\n\\n\",\n",

So we decided to create this.\\nWhat it does\\nVRoom-VRoom is an immersive user experience that integrates virtual reality via an Oculus Rift. The user controls a miniature vehicle trapped inside a tabletop maze with the objective of finding the treasure hidden at the center of the labyrinth. With a first-person view through Rift, the user guides the vehicle by sending directions through a Myo armband. The user’s movements are translated into instructions for Spark Core which causes the car to move in the direction desired by the user. \\nHow we built it\\nThe final version of the vehicle consists of a body built with stacked Jenga blocks secured with duct tape. Two servos lie beneath the main body and are attached to wheels that we salvaged from a box of old Legos. The vehicle is completely wireless as it is powered by a 9V battery and controlled through a wi-fi connected Spark Core. The user can determine the car’s path through Myo by using hand gestures that correspond with different directions.\\nThe maze takes the up the entire top of a circular table with a 6-foot diameter. The walls were constructed with cardboard and duct tape and are taller than the user’s line of sight when viewing through Rift. \\nThe back of the car holds a smartphone that streams the live video feed to a computer, which is then viewed by the user through a connected Oculus Rift. This cockpit view is intended to give the user the feeling of physically being inside the maze.\\nCar: Jenga blocks, duct tape, servos, Spark Core, wheels for Lego, more tape\\nMaze: Cardboard, duct tape\\nVisual Simulation: Oculus VR and Virtual Desktop, Thalmic Myo armband, video conferencing software\\nWhat's next for VRoom-VRoom\\nWe wanted to create an engaging experience for a first-time user of Rift and Myo while providing a fun, simple objective for them to accomplish. This project will encourage new users (including us!) to further explore the growing applications of virtual reality technologies. For example, VRoom-VRoom could be used to inspect spaces that are too small or dangerous for human beings like air conditioning vents or unstable terrain caused by natural disaster. With further development, the use of a Myo Armband could even allow technicians to provide remote repairs and emergency responders to deliver medical treatment and crucial supplies. From a recreational standpoint, activities like VR Drone racing already exist, and many more are popping up. This project suggests the possibility of VR RC Car racing and other mini-vehicle activities.\\nWhat we’d like to improve about VRoom-VRoom\\nBetter control of the car.\\nMore immersive VR UX. \\n\",\n",

Yet there are more problems and more causes to take up than ever before. LeadUp is our solution, creating a platform for mobilization of people who care about an issue but aren’t sure how to turn that care into action. \\nWhat it does\\nThere are two roles to take in LeadUp: everyday users and content creators. Every day users will be updated with stories related to issues they care about, with these preferences taken down at signup. These users also indicate the preference of notification based on proximity (local, national, international), to further personalize the scope of care. After being presented with a news story (the ones which trend/are most popular while meeting the criteria of user preferences are pushed to the top to create mass action), there are options to post online using a consolidated hashtag, but also options to act in real time with the cause, through donation of time, money, or even contact info to direct the user to the necessary persons. Content creators indicate local events and other things taking place in the area for people to participate with. \\nHow I built it\\nWe designed our application using Photoshop, created a fully functional prototype of our application using InVision, and coded the framework of our back-end code using C++. To create data visualizations of the social issues included in the app, we gathered data from two sources: websites we scraped using Python and datasets from Data.gov.

The first is a program that can be loaded onto any embedded device that is connected to the internet.  It works by sending out a ping on the wifi system that the device is connected to through the closest router, and then collecting data on the number of devices connected to the internet through that router.

We learned the most about OS detection on wifi networks, but we also gained a lot of experience in data processing and website design.  Overall this taught the entire team about time management and efficiently splitting up tasks.\\nWhat's next for IP Linkr\\nWe intend to develop more intensive scans and packet sniffing.  We would also like to bring IP Linkr to a broader range of devices like mobile phones.\\n\",\n",

       " {'description': '\\nInspiration\\nWe wanted to create a game that provided the social aspects and open structure of board games while bringing the interactivity and unique experiences of a video game.\\nWhat it does\\nThe game plays out with one player facilitating the experience, talking the players through a dungeon as the explore it. As the \"Game Master\" takes players through this game they will encounter random fights, bosses, and loot while exploring, however players are encouraged to go beyond just the gaming aspect of this creation to allow the GM to describe the world and actions in details. The GM paints the world, story, and background, as well as handles the actions of the players, while the game provides the players with a break from \"rolling dice\" to advanced their adventure.\\nHow we built it\\nWe used a plugin for UE4 that allowed the Arduino to be accessed via write and read commands through the serial port. By using this the game engine could take real time data from the players and GM, such as player movement, awarding loot, and experience, or other areas then pass data back for the GM or players. The players interact through a series of tile based movement, the play a simple turn based game to determine the outcome of fights with enemies.\\nChallenges we ran into\\nWe faced many challenges while going through this project, namely getting the Arduino to talk with UE4.When we found a plugin that allowed us to do it through visual scripting that made the process significantly easier. However the code to allow adequate back and forth communication between the Arduino and UE4 was difficult to manage to allow data and variables to be passed back and fourth.\\nAccomplishments that we\\'re proud of\\nWe created the whole thing through UE4\\'s visual scripting since none of us had to much experience coding a full game before. It was incredibly challenging getting all the code to work properly, especially some of the more in depth mechanics of the game but seeing a video game interact with the world around in such a way was incredible to see brought to life. \\nWhat we learned\\nWe learned a lot along the way in this project. It furthered our understanding in code and the way programs interact with each other, and helped us learn to really think about the process of designing a creative and fun way to interact with games and media. It helped some of us learn the aspects of game design that we really enjoyed and showed us how to work together to really highlight each of our skills. This project helped really learn the importance of prototyping a project though, and how even if it isn\\'t the prettiest product, it can show the functionality of an idea quickly.\\nWhat\\'s next for Twitch_Names_Our_Game: Neckbeard Samurai\\nWe would like to change the way the Arduino interacts with the UE4 by making the sensors IR or NFC instead. This would lower player effort to enjoy the game as well as allow it to write and read data to the chips to store important character information, allowing you to use your figure wherever you are without needing the computer you were on. We would also like to expand this idea from just D&D style games, allowing for a whole realm of physical games to take advantage of it. Imagine playing risk, but instead of rolling dice to fight you engage in a WW2 style FPS with the person you are trying to take over, or Monopoly that stimulates economic consequences of on player getting to much power, maybe a card game that allows you to level up and fight each other without just reading numbers off a piece of cardboard, or pandemic where you have to fight through waves of zombies to get through the city. There are so many areas and ideas we could apply this to that would really bring board games into the 21st century allowing more depth and creativity to the fun social environment of classic games.\\n',\n",

You used to be able to make friends without worrying about the influence of social or online media. In this day and age, it ‘s common to watch “social” media disconnect users from their social lives. We add people on Facebook, follow on twitter like their posts etc. however, this is either amplified so much to the extent that all of our networking is done online or subliminally leveraged to the extent that you waste some of your networking on Facebook but do not leave enough room to connect with people in reality.\\nWhat it does\\nThe purpose of our app is to create a very simple game to induce social interaction among strangers. This game exists as a social catalyst for people to connect with each other and establish real connections. This is done by making this game purely multiplayer and leveraging the Bluetooth/NFC and wifi capabilities. This game is simple in the fact that it takes approximately 30 seconds for the average game to be finished. This allows just the correct amount of time for people to connect in person and hopefully establish a meaningful connection. In order to maximize this game to reach the success of other major VR games, we are including a team aspect within this game. There are 3 simple but engaging games we will be making, as well as a 3 family/trio system. This will allow people within 1 family to play together with games of their choice, and improve their family score. As well, players can play with people in other families in a random game which will allow the spontaneous environment for them to connect and establish real-time relationships.\\nHow we built it\\nTo make the game engaging in the niche market we are engaging, we have used the suggestions made by Tatsumi Kimishima, the CEO of Nintendo. Stating that an ideal game has to include: semi-complex challenges, opportunities for advancement in rank, a competitive aspect, and potential social connections. People are curious, and we love to exploit that. Using platforms such as Java and Android, we hope to expand this game into the palm of the “average Joe”’s hand.\\nChallenges we ran into\\nGetting the app from Java into Android so that it's accessible from any mobile.\\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\\nWe’re particularly proud of creating this whole concept from scratch.

       " {'description': '\\nInspiration\\nIt started out with meeting new people. We never met before and we decided to share our common interests. We came wanted to design a system that would evaluate a person\\\\s mood and respond accordingly. It turned out to be a simple AI but it started from the passion to develop something innovative and revolutionary. Our inspiration came from indicoio to develop an AI and from the theme of the event which was to entertain. \\nWhat it does\\nOur program asks a series of questions to the user to better understand their preferences in real time. Their answers are propelled through a series of arrays. Information from the movies, with tremendous amounts of credit given to IMDb (HTML files), was used to identify the movies that would closely align with the user\\'s preferences. \\nHow I built it\\nLaboriously, over a handful of sleepless nights and sunlight-less days. Over the course of the weekend, the work was split up between two people. One person worked on determining a systematic way to read HTML files from IMDb, extracting movie information and supplying it in 2D Array. The other person would program the user interface as well as the scale that rates the movies from \"most preferred\" to \"least preferred\" based on the user\\'s responses to the user\\'s questions. \\nChallenges I ran into\\nIt was difficult to coordinate individually coded files to form a cohesive program. The most challenging portion of this endeavor was to scan the HTML files for data. Unfortunately, there were many spelling mistakes in their code. Thus, one method of data extraction would work for most webpages, while for others the program would just crash. Many exceptions (as it\\'s called in Java) were caught and dealt with appropriately. It would have been nicer to work with properly formatted HTML files so that random punctuation (like commas) wouldn\\'t cause random, unnecessary errors. \\nAccomplishments that I\\'m proud of\\nWe were able to work around poorly formatted files and extract most of the data that we needed. We were able to write nearly 500 (more or less) lines of code in 20 hrs. My teammate and I enjoyed the workshops and we were able to work quickly and collaborate well to produce the final product. This sort of teamwork is a fundamental quality to every project (especially programming, where code is shared and integrated together). We were also able to debug the program after integration, because although this part took the shortest amount of time, we kept our cool. Our greatest accomplishment was matching the user\\'s response to an appropriate film. The algorithm that we developed works to a sufficient efficiency and effectiveness. \\nWhat I learned\\nWe learned how to access the Internet using Java, how to read HTML, and that we can churn out quite a bit of code with patience. In a team of two, it was easy to share code, files and ideas, especially because we were face to face. In larger teams, communication is key to a successful product. Furthermore, every good project starts out with a plan. If you do not know what code to consider, what algorithms to develop, what audience to address to, it can be very difficult to produce anything effective. We learned to make our code modular, design our code for readability and iterate through several algorithms of code to perform the same task (and obviously choose the most effective and/or efficient one based on our needs). \\nWhat\\'s next for Movie Recommendation Machine\\nIn the future, we would like to try out indicoio\\'s API to include special features like facial emotion recognition to generate a link to a film that would make the person happier. We would like to store this data so that future movie recommendations for the user (based on the API of facial features, and facial emotion recognition) are personalized. Due to a lack of time and manpower (team of 2!), we could not implement all the features that we wanted to.  For example, we wanted to provide a map (we knew how to do this in Greenfoot) to the nearest cinema for the latest movie (an added genre that was also not included, among others) or a link to a legal movie website. \\n',\n",

This lead to our inclusion of uploading our database to Parse and on app load quickly reading this information in. From within the app we make Indico.io api calls every time the user asks a question and compares it to the database to produce the lyric as the response.\\nComing from the back, a simple Java program was created to \\n\\nread in Drake lyrics\\ncall and retrieve the Indico.io information from the API call for each lyric \\nSave it all as a .csv file to be uploaded to the parse cloud.\\n\\nWhat we\\'d do with more time\\nSince the backend is loaded up through parse the opportunity to expand \"Ask the 6god\" to more platforms is available.

They are one of the world's fastest growing industries, with enterprises around the world exploring their widespread deployment. The difficulty, however, lies in efficiently managing them without unnecessary loitering and wasted time.\\nWhat It Does\\nDrone Flight Area Control, or DFAC for short, maintains a list of drones and tasks, and sends drones out to those tasks in the most efficient order. The drones and tasks can be monitored and managed through the DFAC web interface, which allows the user to visualize the layout of the tasks, keep track of the drones and their current tasks, and add, modify, and remove tasks. The interactions with the DFAC backend, however, are limitless. Data is exchanged via HTTP GET and JSON, so there are many innovative possibilities for managing the drones and tasks. This also means DFAC can be used as a scheduling and control backend to existing applications.\\nWho Did What\\nThe DFAC backend and interface was developed by Mark Omo, and the DFAC web interface was developed by James Rowley.\\nHow I Built It\\nMark:\\nThe DFAC backend is a multi-tiered, multi-threaded, socket driven system, which allows it to be infinitely extensible and scalable to hundreds of task regions and hundreds of thousands of drones. The backend is entirely python based, leveraging existing resources, and enabling quick additions and modifications. Adding new types or classes of UAVs is very easy, and seamless integration into the current tasking system allows them to execute tasks tailored to their strengths.\\nJames:\\nThe DFAC web interface is a fully client-side webapp which can be either served as a static webpage or run from disk. It utilizes the basics web technologies, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as jQuery and the Google Maps API. jQuery is used for interaction with the DFAC backend as well as various simplifications, and the Google Maps API is used for displaying the map, the tasks and the drones, as well as for selecting a location for a new task. The interface is also scalable, and usable on mobile devices.\\nChallenges I Ran Into\\nMark:\\nEnsuring the application was thread safe and did not require cross thread variables was a challenge, along with ensuring the whole system meshed together and could meet the load demands of many vehicles at the same time.\\nJames:\\nI have never written a real-time webapp before, so getting the data to update and synchronize with the server in a timely manner was a challenge. Additionally, getting the CSS to cooperate and not send entire sections off the page while still being scalable and extensible was tough at times.\\nAccomplishments That I'm Proud Of\\nMark:\\nGetting the system working in the short time we were allotted was the biggest achievement in my eyes, along with keeping the server thread safe, and eliminating the possibility of the threads tripping on one another.\\nJames:\\nI'm definitely proud of getting the whole thing to run smoothly and interact with the DFAC backend, while being able to handle hundreds of tasks and drones scalably. Also I'm pretty happy with the overall look and feel, as well as the drone and marker graphics.\\nWhat I Learned\\nMark:\\nI learned the importance of writing agreeable system interface documents. James and I went back and forth several times on the structure and terminology used in the application interface, using only text chat to boot, so getting the interface right was a learning experience.\\nJames:\\nThis was my first time working with jQuery, which I was a bit reluctant to pick up, but I've seen the light and learned quite a bit about what seems to be one of the most prominent web frameworks. I also picked up a bit of python from modifying the dummy server, so that's nice.\\nWhat's Next for Drone Flight Area Control\\nIn the future, we want to build in specific applications to assist with task creation, including automatic response to traffic congestion, traffic accidents, and emergencies, automatic industrial and commercial inspection (i.e. inspecting a skyscraper or pipeline), and features targeted for search and rescue applications. In terms of specific features, we want to add result collection and presentation for tasks, a log of previous tasks and drone actions, alerts for completed tasks and drone problems, and task prioritization. For the frontend, we want to add paths/trails for the drone as well as heading of the drone.\\n\",\n",

Realizing the scale of that was impractical and unsafe for a first build, we decided to scale this down.\\nWhat it does\\nThe aim of this unit is to allow the end user to control a laser that can rotate about an axis and can change its pitch. An Oculus Rift allows the end user to control the drone with his or her head. A dedicated fire button controls the laser.\\nHow we built it\\nWe used a variety of manufacturing methods to build hardware unit. The base of our drone MDF (medium density fiber) board. It provides a very sturdy base for our turret. The lower part of our turret is a 3D printed custom designed base. It contains a racetrack ridge that we will detail in a bit. We used PLA for this part as it was readily available. Additive manufacturing allowed is to incorporate a racetrack on board, on which we have several marbles acting as ball bearings. On top of these marbles rests the upper part of our turret. Containing a another race track, and connected to a motor shaft in the center, this part is free to rotate. The ball bearings allow for reduced friction here. On top of turret sits another motor to which an armature is connected. On which rests our 10 miliWatt laser. The armature is free to move in the vertical axis allowing for our second degree of freedom. Lastly on top of the laser holding mechanism, rests a webcam. This provides a direct feed to our user.\\nOn the electronics side, we use a raspberry pi as our turret controller. This is also connected to a motor controller shield powering two NEMA 17 motors. Additionally, a relay controls power to a laser while a button allows for a software trigger of the laser. The oculus control computer is a mac. It is connected the webcam and Oculus Rift. The rift provides a head mounted display as well as an inertial measurement unit to provide orientation information. The mac and pi are connected via CAT 5 ethernet.\\nThe software on the pi is a heavily modified version of Adafruits motor controller example code written in. The oculus controller is a C++ code base, based on Occulus in Action. The systems are connected by a UDP packet linked.\\nChallenges we ran into\\n\\nAccidental corruption of raspberry pi file system - Fixed by using a recovery software to rescue code before formatting the drive.\\n3D printer misalignment issue - During the print of the upper turret piece the printer was off by 3 millimeters. This eliminated some symmetrical aspects of our design. Solved with liberal use of a mini Dremel. \\n\\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\\n\\nControlling a laser\\nWorking with a interdisciplinary team of an engineering project. We had a Computer Science major, two Aerospace engineers, an Optical engineering engineer with minors in ECE,CS and math and lastly a CS and Aerospace engineering major. We were able to work together and play the strengths of our team.\\n\\nWhat we learned\\n\\n3D printing and metals don't mix too well\\nAlways backup code\\n\\nWhat's next for Oculus Rift Controlled Laser Turret\\n\\nBetter resolution for webcam\\nDepth of vision\\nHighlighting of unit\\nAutonomous tracking of targets\\nAutonomous firing on targets\\nBetter optics (lens mounts) for wider beam spread\\n\\n\",\n",

       " {'description': \"\\nInspiration\\nAt every hackathon our team attends, we make it our goal to use Virtual Reality for good. Ranging from education to major social issues, we use VR to address what we believe needs the most change. Virtual Reality is a technology that can express thoughts, emotions, and experiences, and can therefore convey themes like no other medium truly can. Therefore, when talking about a subject that one must truly experience to understand, depression quickly came to mind.\\nDepression is a powerful force that, most often, can only be understood from the inside. It's hard for others to differentiate between real depression and sadness. We wanted to create a VR experience that would allow those who haven't been through depression begin to understand how serious of an illness it really is. \\nResearch\\nA huge part of our project was actually researching depression. This was also the most impactful and eye-opening part of the entire hackathon. We all headed to online forums, social media sites, and chat rooms, trying to gather data through a prepared google form we wanted to spread to people who had experienced depression. The result was more than we could have ever asked for. By the time of our submission, nearly thirty individuals had anonymously shared their stories, backgrounds, and views with us. Each entry held a great deal of emotion, and without this research, we could have never understood what depressed people really feel. Each response was rewarding, but at the same time very somber as we read through personal accounts of depression.\\nWhat it does\\nAnother Day places you, the user, inside a bedroom that is initially filled with light. The first task in the game is simply to close the blinds and stop the blinding sunlight from entering. In the game, this sunlight is symbolically radiant and shining throughout the whole room. This is only the first step in helping our users understand depression.\\nThe experience, as is, mainly involves looking around your bedroom and investigating items. Although many of these objects are completely ordinary, it's the unique thoughts that accompany each interaction that marks the signs of depression. We sought to focus heavily on feelings of apathy and reflection, noting how you- the protagonist- slowly descended into a state of demotivation and lack of care for the world. These thoughts literally appear on the screen, and each discovery gives even further insight.\\nAt the conclusion of the room experience, we take a more direct approach to the issue by quoting the anonymous survey responders and explaining the hardest parts of depression. We also, however, believe that any project focused on depression needs a glimmer of hope. After carefully reading each interview, we selected quotes that focused on recovery, hope, and advice to others with depression. We put those together into an ending moment for the Virtual Reality experience, that seeks to empower a user to reach out and show compassion toward those with depression. It's everyone's responsibility.\\nHow we built it\\nWe built Another Day using the Unity Game Engine and the Samsung Gear VR. All scripts were coded in C#, and the application was tested on a Samsung Galaxy S6. Some of our 3D Models in the experience were created using Maya. We further used Google Forms to send out our surveys.\\nChallenges we ran into\\nDepression is a deep, powerful, and complex feeling that is incredibly hard to grasp without direct experience with it. We had to approach this problem cautiously, because if we weren't careful, we could entirely misrepresent the real problem at hand. We had to help others understand depression, but if we didn't understand ourselves, we would become enemies of our own cause. As a result, and because we wanted to be thorough, we chose to spend a majority of our time spreading an online survey to depression forums and other forums of social media. We lost a lot of time, but it was worth it.\\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\\nDepression:\\nOur entire team learned much more than we ever thought we would. We discovered the ugly truths about depression, the scary realities, and then attempted to make that into an actual experience. It was a morose situation, and we achieved our work with a heavy heart. However, in the end, we grew as individuals and allied ourselves to a cause that was previously unknown. Regardless of the project quality, we learned a great deal about depression, and therefore achieved our ultimate goal in at least a small sense.\\nGear VR:\\nThough we often develop with Virtual Reality, this was our first time developing with the Gear VR, Samsung's mobile solution to Virtual Reality. In turn, it was our first time building for Android on Unity, and we found that there were quite a few tricks we encountered. However, in the end, we were able to overcome the new hardware and create a worthwhile experience.\\nWhat we learned\\nHonestly, what we learned from this project was far less about technical skill and far more about the severity of depression. The more we dedicated to our work, the more we became invested in the cause we're trying to support. We read first-hand accounts of depressed individuals, walked through their lives, tried to understand their minds. We had to put ourselves in that place, and then ask how we can show what we learned to others. We grew humbled by our research and our project, and gained a valuable lesson that few other subjects can provide.\\nWhat's next for Another Day\\nThis is a project we want to grow. Depression cannot just be represented in a five minute demo, and certainly not in a project that was thrown together rapidly in 36 hours. It's a massive subject that requires care, and we want to continue to perfect it. We want it to be something that can accurately capture a depressed mind. Through more research, actual tests with our target audience, and refined themes, we believe that Another Day can become a sobering educational and relatable experience for everyone.\\n\",\n",

       " {'description': \"\\nPlease visit our website for more information!!\\nInspiration\\nSpurred by wanting to find a hack that bridged each of our specialties (optical sciences, biomedical engineering, and computer science) in addition to the recent Ebola outbreak and epidemics in general, the X-Terminator Drone was born. This hack aims to reduce the risk of healthcare workers and volunteers in the face of an epidemic by using drones to UV sterilize the field. \\nWhat it does\\nThe X-Terminator Drone uses UV light that is reflected off of sputter-coated aluminum propeller blades to inactivate viruses (by irreversibly damaging its genetic material), making them no longer deadly and unable to replicate. The ultimate application of this hack is for healthcare facilities and patient clinics to be sterilized of harmful pathogenic diseases without need for human contact with deadly viruses and pathogens. High-risk areas can be first sanitized by a drone prior to human contact.\\nHow we built it\\nTo automate the Parrot AR Drone 2.0 Elite, an Arduino Uno connected to multiple ultrasonic distance sensors was connected to the drone. Each propeller blade was sputter-coated with aluminum metal (~50nm thick) to reflect UV light. A UV light source was mounted under each propeller blade at an ideal distance from the blade to best reflect the UV light below the drone (the physics is explained on our website). Finally, the drone itself was programmed to autonomously roam a room via feedback from its distance sensors mounted in each direction, at an altitude permitting UV inactivation of viruses and pathogens. \\nChallenges we ran into\\nThis was a very technical hack that involved many endless hours of troubleshooting, especially since none of us had done many of the technical hardware and software hacks involved. We were new to the Arduino and drones, as well as how to build the circuits we needed. This hack first involved identifying multiple UV light sources, of which we went through a couple LED light options before our final solution. Along the way, we encountered faulty hardware, and our procedure of soldering and connecting our initial ideal higher-powered UV LED lights resulted in their electrical failure. We then had to improvise and go with another set of different LED lights that were in the UV spectrum. Next, there is little documentation of hacking a Parrot Drone with an Arduino that combines all of the endpoints we included in our hack. \\nBeginning with wiring the circuitry on breadboards to connect multiple distance sensors to the Arduino, we encountered issues with the readout and responses that we had to troubleshoot. Part of the issues were related to the voltage, and we eventually figured this out. Next, there were differences in Drone pinouts than what was posted online, we had to identify through voltage drops and differences the functions of the pinouts, and then connect the drone to the Arduino. For many hours, we were only able to connect successfully the computer to the Arduino and receive proper printouts from the sensors, and not from the Arduino to the drone. To solve this issue, we had to seek some advice on matching the voltages between our various types of hardware in order for all of our code, hardware and sensors to communicate. Based off of the advice and feedback we received, and online forums, we put together a level converter to divide voltage that allowed communication between the sensors, drone, and Arduino to finally happen (BUT, not before we faced a malfunctioning Arduino, and after using a fresh one we figured out that this had been the problem for a couple hours). \\nNext, we had to weigh all the components and shave off any excess weight-- considering a second voltage divider to draw less energy. After that, we had to figure out the actual hardware and mechanical mounting of the LED lights. The next challenge was consolidating all of our multiple circuits into one small and lightweight board. Then finally, we wanted to command the flight of the drone to be similar to an iRoomba vacuum. We wrote javascript to automate the this type of room sweep via drone flight movements. This was one of the toughest hacks, as it was not clear in any instructional references we could find how to actually control the drone via the Arduino while using the sensors. We spent at least a full 16 hours on trying to get the communications between the devices working. Finally, we succeeded in reflecting UV light off our of drone propellers at the end, which allowed us to consider our hack a proof-of-concept for use during an epidemic. \\nAccomplishments that we are proud of\\nThe amazing collaborative teamwork and the fact my team worked together non-stop to make this happen! What an incredible effort, especially given that none of us have done much of the things we had to figure out for this hackathon. We each learned how to integrate and utilize new hardware, software components and languages, and had to draw from past science classes as far back as high school for the scientific concepts.\\nWhat we learned\\nMany many things, already alluded to in the challenges section... mostly along the lines of working with new hardware, circuits, writing Arduino code, working with Arduino libraries, interfacing multiple technologies, hacking a drone, new/unfamiliar coding languages, etc. \\nWhat's next for X-Terminator Drone\\nTrying to find the support to turn this drone into a reality where it can be utilized out in the field. What would be ideal is to use holograms on the propeller blades, instead of aluminum, and to use a high-powered UV laser. The future drone will also come with a companion rover that is a land-based robot that can manipulate obstacles and objects in the environment to deal with unfamiliar terrain and situations.\\nImportant video links that should be viewed to show we've done technically! Since we were not allowed to demo our hack the way it was meant to be used indoors:\\n1) Ultrasonic distance sensors working: https://youtu.be/2WZT5U6yAT4\\n2) Sputter coated aluminum propellers: https://youtu.be/uWcDtlGyKJg\\n\",\n",

The microcontroller was also connected through a Bluetooth module to the computer. IT is important to emphasize the robot was build by us but prior the competition.\\nThe main goal of the project was to send commands and/or instructions to a spark-fun robot without any joystick, or phone input.

There was lots of context switching involved in continuously jumping between developing for iOS, Mac, and the server.\\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\\nBuilding 3 applications in under 24 hours by myself is something that I'm proud of, especially since several of the core technologies I used were new to me.\\nWhat I learned\\n\\nHow to use MongoDB\\nHow to set up and use APNS (Apple Push Notification Service) on both the iOS side and the back-end\\nHow to use the MultipeerConnectivity framework for P2P communication on OS X and iOS\\n\\nWhat's next for Ares\\n\\nBidirectional file transfer: iOS -> Mac transfers in addition to the Mac -> iOS transfer implemented currently\\nA full file manager in the iOS app that lets you view and catalogue files that were previously downloaded over Ares\\nMultiple simultaneous file transfers\\nBetter security in verifying origins and the integrity of delivered payloads\\nFallback to uploading files to a storage server when P2P communication is not available\\niOS action extension for sending content from 3rd party apps via Ares\\n\\n\",\n",

       " {'description': '\\nConcept\\nThe idea of this project is to make an inexpensive WIFI enabled air particle sensor that can log it\\'s historical data on the web for others to use. The data can also be used to send SMS alerts to your cell phone to let you know when the air quality is poor.\\nBackground\\nWith allergies and asthma I\\'m interested in both the indoor and outdoor air quality. I heat with a Quadrafire woodstove. It is suppose to be a clean stove. I was interested in the impact on both my inside air (ie. ash/dust) and outside air (smoke). New York State monitors the air quality at several locations around the State. Certified Allergy & Asthma Consultants in Albany NY published daily pollen counts. \\nWhat I learned today\\nTechnology is changing very quickly in the IoT environment. I learned a ton of new things.\\nThe mentors are the Tech Valley Center Of Gravity Makerspace were wonderful!\\nThanks to Jeff Brunson from Sparkfun, Scot Straight from Makerfront, and Tom Tongue from COG.\\n\\n\\nSparkfun Particle Photon  and the \\nDevelopment  Environment\\n\\nIFTTT IF This Than That alert generation\\n\\nOnShape Solid Modeling\\n\\ndata.sparkfun.com\\ndatalogging\\n\\nAnalog.io Data Graphing\\n\\nHow it Works\\n\\n\\nThe PPD42NS sensor outputs a signal on Pin 6. You measure how long the digital signal on pin is low during the 30 second sample time. This ratio is used in a transfer function to calculate the particles per 0.01 cubic feet.\\n\\n\\nThe air particle concentration is pushed to the Internet in two different ways. The first is thru a\\nspark.variable which is a global variable on the cloud. It can be seen by applications like IFTTT.\\nThe second location is data.sparkfun.com. The Phant library is used to post the data. The data\\ncan be retrieved in several formats: JSON, CSV, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Atom.\\n\\n\\nThe analog.io site reads the data.sparkfun.com site and creates rolling graphs.\\n\\n\\nThe text message alerts are generated using IFTTT. There are connection objects for the particle and SMS.\\n \\n\\nHardware\\n\\n\\nSparkfun Photon Red Board\\n\\nSeeedStudio Dust Sensor\\n\\nMakerfront i3 Pro 3D Printer\\n\\nSoftware\\n/*\\n Interface to Shinyei Model PPD42NS Particle Sensor\\n Program by Christopher Nafis \\n Written January 2016\\n \\n http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/grove-dust-sensor-p-1050.html\\n \\n JST Pin 1 (Black Wire)  => Photon GND\\n JST Pin 3 (Red wire)    => Photon 5VDC\\n JST Pin 4 (Yellow wire) => Photon Digital Pin 6\\n */\\n#include \"math.h\"\\n#include \"SparkFunPhant/SparkFunPhant.h\"\\n\\nint pin = 6;\\nunsigned long duration;\\nunsigned long starttime;\\nunsigned long sampletime_ms = 30000;\\nunsigned long lowpulseoccupancy = 0;\\nfloat ratio = 0;\\ndouble concentration = 0;\\n\\nconst char server[] = \"data.sparkfun.com\"; // Phant destination server\\nconst char publicKey[] = \"your public key\"; // Phant public key\\nconst char privateKey[] = \"your private key\"; // Phant private key\\nPhant phant(server, publicKey, privateKey); // Create a Phant object\\n\\nconst int POST_RATE = 30000; // Time between posts, in ms.\\nunsigned long lastPost = 0; // global variable to keep track of last post time\\n\\nvoid setup() {\\n  Serial.begin(9600);\\n  pinMode(pin,INPUT);\\n  Spark.variable(\"partcons\", &concentration, DOUBLE);\\n  starttime = millis();\\n}\\n\\nvoid loop() {\\n  duration = pulseIn(pin, LOW);\\n  lowpulseoccupancy = lowpulseoccupancy+duration;\\n\\n  if ((millis()-starttime) > sampletime_ms)\\n  {\\n    ratio = lowpulseoccupancy/(sampletime_ms*10.0);  // Integer percentage 0=>100\\n    concentration = 1.1*pow(ratio,3)-3.8*pow(ratio,2)+520*ratio+0.62; // using spec sheet curve\\n    Serial.print(lowpulseoccupancy);\\n    Serial.print(\", \");\\n    Serial.print(ratio);\\n    Serial.print(\", \");\\n    Serial.println(concentration);\\n    lowpulseoccupancy = 0;\\n    \\n    // If it\\'s been POST_RATE ms (default 30 seconds), try to post again.\\n    if (lastPost + POST_RATE < millis())\\n    {\\n        // If the post succeeds, update lastPost so we don\\'t post for\\n        // another 30 seconds.\\n        if (postToPhant() > 0)\\n        {\\n            lastPost = millis();\\n        }\\n        // If the post fails, delay 1s and try again.\\n    }\\n    \\n    starttime = millis();\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nint postToPhant()\\n{\\n    // Use phant.add(, ) to add data to each field.\\n    // Phant requires you to update each and every field before posting,\\n    // make sure all fields defined in the stream are added here.\\n\\n    phant.add(\"air\", concentration);\\n    \\n    TCPClient client;\\n    char response[512];\\n    int i = 0;\\n    int retVal = 0;\\n    \\n    if (client.connect(server, 80)) // Connect to the server\\n    {\\n        // Post message to indicate connect success\\n        Serial.println(\"Posting!\"); \\n        \\n        // phant.post() will return a string formatted as an HTTP POST.\\n        // It\\'ll include all of the field/data values we added before.\\n        // Use client.print() to send that string to the server.\\n        client.print(phant.post());\\n        delay(1000);\\n        // Now we\\'ll do some simple checking to see what (if any) response\\n        // the server gives us.\\n        while (client.available())\\n        {\\n            char c = client.read();\\n            Serial.print(c);    // Print the response for debugging help.\\n            if (i < 512)\\n                response[i++] = c; // Add character to response string\\n        }\\n        // Search the response string for \"200 OK\", if that\\'s found the post\\n        // succeeded.\\n        if (strstr(response, \"200 OK\"))\\n        {\\n            Serial.println(\"Post success!\");\\n            retVal = 1;\\n        }\\n        else if (strstr(response, \"400 Bad Request\"))\\n        {   // \"400 Bad Request\" means the Phant POST was formatted incorrectly.\\n            // This most commonly ocurrs because a field is either missing,\\n            // duplicated, or misspelled.\\n            Serial.println(\"Bad request\");\\n            retVal = -1;\\n        }\\n        else\\n        {\\n            // Otherwise we got a response we weren\\'t looking for.\\n            retVal = -2;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    else\\n    {   // If the connection failed, print a message:\\n        Serial.println(\"connection failed\");\\n        retVal = -3;\\n    }\\n    client.stop();  // Close the connection to server.\\n    return retVal;  // Return error (or success) code.\\n}\\n\\nSome of my other Projects\\n\\n\\nRabbit Powered 1-Wire Weather Station Controller\\n\\n1-Wire Snowfall /Snow Depth Sensor (Automated Snowboard)\\n\\nNetworked Ultrasonic Snow fall / Snow Depth / Water Height Sensor\\n\\nMonitoring Electricity Usage\\n\\nMonitoring Radon Gas Levels\\n\\nAir Quality Monitoring with Dylos DC1100 Paricle Monitor\\n\\n',\n",
